Hi I’m Kyle. I’m an Olympic athlete in the sport of skeleton. When I’m not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I like to read, write, and code.

I tweet from [@kyletress](http://www.twitter.com/kyletress), share photos on [instagram](http://www.instagram.com/kyletress), and make videos on YouTube. You can email me at [kyle@kyletress.com](mailto:kyle@kyletress.com).

I’ve been fascinated with technology ever since I built my first website in 1994. I’ve worked with many different languages, tools, and technologies over the years, but I’m mostly interested in Ruby on Rails and iOS development. Former clients include [Capital Health System New Jersey](http://www.capitalhealth.org), [Design by Diane Alder](http://www.designbydianealder.com), USA Bobsled and Skeleton, and Nature of Speed, LLC.

Aside from skeleton and technology, I’m interested in flourishing, a concept from the field of positive psychology that means to live within the optimal range of human existence. I approach flourishing from an interdisciplinary standpoint by reading and conducting research in the fields of performance, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, computation, and future studies.
