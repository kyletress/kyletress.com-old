<p><a href="">Sledsheet</a> is a Ruby on Rails web application I built for managing, graphing, and analyzing my skeleton runs. I was frustrated by the process of manually calculating my intermediate and difference times every day after training, and not having access to historical data which could help me make better decisions based on track and conditions. I came up with idea to build a web app that would unlock the powerful data hidden in every time sheet, as well as allow me to search through past days, graph runs, and track runner changes.</p>

<p>I initially built the site in Rails 3, rebuilt it in Rails 3.1, and finally am undergoing the process of transitioning to Rails 4. I built  authentication from scratch (using the wonderful Has<em>Secure</em>Password helper) and built out the entire site using <em>test driven development</em>. I took advantage of some great gems like Paperclip, Acts as List, and more.</p>

<p>The code base revolves around the Timesheet model. The timesheet </p>
