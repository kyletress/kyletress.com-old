<p>I first learned about skeleton in 2002 during the Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games. I clicked a link on the Yahoo! homepage which led to an article about the success of the U.S. team. I decided immediately that I wanted to be a skeleton athlete. 4 months later I enrolled in a summer recruitment camp and 5 months after that I was in Lake Placid for my first skeleton school. </p>

<p>Over the next few years I worked my way through the U.S ranks. In 2004 I was awarded the <a href="http://www.rpmfund.org">Randy Price Memorial Award</a> for excellence in sportsmanship, an honor of which I&rsquo;m extremely proud. I won my first international medal in 2005 with a 2<sup>nd</sup> place finish in the European Cup in Igls, Austria. I competed on the North American Cup for many years, winning the overall title in 2010. </p>

<p>I competed in a few World Cup races during these years as well, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the 2011 season that I made the full-time jump to the World Cup level. My first World Championships event was in Konigssee, Germany in 2011. </p>

<h3>Sochi Winter Olympic Games</h3>

<p>After a difficult start to the 2013/2014 season, I had strong results in Lake Placid and Europe which qualified me for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games. I finished the World Cup season ranked 12<sup>th</sup> in the world heading into Sochi. </p>

<p>The Olympics were an incredible experience, but in hindsight I made stupid mistakes. I didn&rsquo;t manage my time and energy efficiently, and I didn&rsquo;t race to win. At the end of my final heat, I walked into the locker room at the finish dock and promised myself I&rsquo;d be back and better in 4 years. Today <em>I&rsquo;m entirely focused on winning a medal at the 2018 Games in Korea</em>. I know where I need to improve and I&rsquo;m confident I can do so. I&rsquo;m  fortunate to have a <a href="http://www.morgantracey.us">strong</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/gmtn">support system</a> around me.</p>
