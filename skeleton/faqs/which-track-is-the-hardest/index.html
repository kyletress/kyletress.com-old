<p>Difficulty is subjective. There are many athletes who find Lake Placid challenging, but because I learned how to slide here and have 2000 runs on the track, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it difficult. </p>

<p>If I had to choose, I&rsquo;d say Altenberg and Whistler are two of the hardest tracks in the world. But most tracks are difficult in their own ways, maybe not in terms of safely getting to the bottom, but doing it fast. </p>
