<p>I advise people to wait at least <em>one full season</em> before purchasing equipment. Most people ignore this advice.</p>

<p>The reason I recommend you wait is because you won&rsquo;t have any clue what you&rsquo;re doing your first year. You&rsquo;ll probably have 2-3 months of time on the track, and you might take 10-15 runs per week. This time should be dedicated to building awareness, perfecting your form, getting a feel for the track, and soaking up as much knowledge as you can from the coaches. Messing around with equipment to try and go faster isn&rsquo;t a priority yet. Plus, any sled you buy will likely be too sensitive for your abilities. The same goes with runners.</p>
