<p>Congratulations! Making the decision is the easy part. Now you have to work <em>insanely hard</em> for the next 8&ndash;12 years while sacrificing everything, freezing your ass off, and racking up a bunch of debt. <em>Maybe</em> you&rsquo;ll make the team in 2022.</p>

<p>Qualifying for the Olympics is a long road, and the 2018 team is going to be made up of athletes who are already in our program. There are no <em>wunderkinds</em> waiting to be discovered, who will pick up the sport in four years and compete for an Olympic medal in 2018. It takes years of experience to develop the skill to compete at a high level on every track in the world. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged. Show up, commit, and work hard. Good things will happen if you stick it out.</p>
