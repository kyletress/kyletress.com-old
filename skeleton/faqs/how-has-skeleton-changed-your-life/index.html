    <p>In more ways than I could mention. Everything fell into place when I saw skeleton for the first time. Prior to that, I was directionless. I dropped in and out of school, played in a band, and considered pursuing a career as an actor. After seeing skeleton, I didn&rsquo;t need to read about it, or research it, I just knew it was <em>it</em>. </p>

<p>Skeleton pushed me in ways I never expected. It taught me to appreciate hard work, because that&rsquo;s the reward. It allowed me to travel the world. It introduced me to <a href="http://www.morgantracey.us">my girlfriend</a> and two of my <a href="http://www.mattantoine.com">best</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/johndalyusa">friends</a>. It gave me <a href="/skeleton/sochi">one of the greatest moments in my life</a>, and enough memories and friendships to last a lifetime. </p>

<p>I also hated to fly. Now, with 20+ flights per year, it&rsquo;s one of my favorite things to do.</p>
