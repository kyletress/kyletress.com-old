  <h1>What were the Olympics like?</h1>
</header>

<p>The Olympics were an amazing experience. It was my first time competing, so I had nothing else to compare them to. I heard from more experienced Olympians that Sochi didn&rsquo;t really have the atmosphere of other Olympics, but nonetheless I was impressed. </p>

<p>Yes it was warm. I considered that a feature. I was never worried about security, and the measures in place weren&rsquo;t intrusive. Transportation was good and the crowds showed up. </p>

<p>Opening Ceremonies was my favorite part of the experience, because it lived up to the hype. Walking into the Fischt Stadium is something I will never forget. It gives me chills just writing this. Definitlely the highlight of my Games.</p>
