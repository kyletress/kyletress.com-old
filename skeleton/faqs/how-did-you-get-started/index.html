<p>I found skeleton by accident. In 2002 during the Salt Lake City Olympics, I clicked a link on the Yahoo! homepage that said &lsquo;Third Generation Olympian Wins Gold in Skeleton&rsquo;. I had no idea what skeleton was, but something about that headline caught my interest. As soon as I saw it, I knew immediately it was for me. I registered for a training camp in the summer, a skeleton school in the winter (in Lake Placid), and after my very first trip down the track I decided to commit to making the Olympic Team. That process took me 12 years, which seems to be about average.</p>
