<p>The combine is a standardized test to measure speed, power, and strength of bobsled and skeleton athletes. There are three tiers. If you are a brand new skeleton athlete (tier 1), you will be asked to take three 45m sprints through timing eyes. From the timing data, the coaches will get 15, 30, flying 30, and 45 meter sprint times. Then you will be asked to do an underhand shot toss and a standing broad jump. Your score will be calculated according to a points table.</p>

<p>Most current athletes (Tier 2) also complete a weight room portion, including a 3RM back squat and a 1RM clean.</p>

<p>Tier 3 athletes are those who have competed in an Olympic Games or World Championships in the past two years. Tier 3 athletes don&rsquo;t take a formal combine, but are instead monitored through their strength and conditioning coaches. </p>
