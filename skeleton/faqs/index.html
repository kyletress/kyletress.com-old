    <dt><a name="how-should-i-prepare-for-skeleton-school" class="anchor"></a>How should I prepare for Skeleton School? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>There is no preparation necessary for Skeleton School. You don&rsquo;t need to learn how to drive beforehand &ndash; you <em>can&rsquo;t</em>. You can only learn that aspect of the sport through experience, which comes with taking runs down the track. Skeleton School is mostly an opportunity to see if you really enjoy the sport. It looks fun on TV, but there have been many people who thought the same thing only to arrive in Lake Placid, take a run, and leave that same day never to return. Just show up, listen to the coaches, and see if you like it.</p>

    <dt><a name="how-much-longer-will-you-compete" class="anchor"></a>How much longer will you compete? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The best answer I can give is <em>at least through 2018</em>. Skeleton athletes can be competitive into their 40s. I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> saying I will be, but it&rsquo;s possible. </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="what-is-your-best-world-cup-finish" class="anchor"></a>What is your best World Cup finish? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>It&rsquo;s a tie: 5<sup>th</sup> in Lake Placid (2013) and St. Moritz (2014).</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="when-should-i-buy-my-first-sled" class="anchor"></a>When should I buy my first sled? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>I advise people to wait at least <em>one full season</em> before purchasing equipment. Most people ignore this advice.</p>

<p>The reason I recommend you wait is because you won&rsquo;t have any clue what you&rsquo;re doing your first year. You&rsquo;ll probably have 2-3 months of time on the track, and you might take 10-15 runs per week. This time should be dedicated to building awareness, perfecting your form, getting a feel for the track, and soaking up as much knowledge as you can from the coaches. Messing around with equipment to try and go faster isn&rsquo;t a priority yet. Plus, any sled you buy will likely be too sensitive for your abilities. The same goes with runners.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="what-kind-of-training-should-i-be-doing" class="anchor"></a>What kind of training should I be doing? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>I recommend you find a good sprint coach, as speed development is probably the most important training for skeleton. If you&rsquo;re in high school, join the track team. Otherwise, ask around at local colleges and find a coach you can train with once or twice per week.</p>

<p>Strength is important too. You will need to focus on major lifts like squats and presses. Familiarizing yourself with the Olympic lifts (like the power clean) and get help if necessary. Proper form is important. </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="how-long-before-i-make-the-national-team" class="anchor"></a>How long before I make the National Team? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The National Team consists of the top 5 or 6 men and women in the United States. It used to be larger, but has been narrowed down in recent years. It may take several seasons to make the National Team, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you won&rsquo;t be racing in competitive events. The development team travels throughout North America and Europe as well, and occasionally bumps up to higher circuits throughout the season. The development circuits are a great place to learn the sport and the tracks so you will be ready to compete when you make the team.  </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="which-track-is-the-hardest" class="anchor"></a>Which track is the most difficult? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Difficulty is subjective. There are many athletes who find Lake Placid challenging, but because I learned how to slide here and have 2000 runs on the track, I wouldn&rsquo;t call it difficult. </p>

<p>If I had to choose, I&rsquo;d say Altenberg and Whistler are two of the hardest tracks in the world. But most tracks are difficult in their own ways, maybe not in terms of safely getting to the bottom, but doing it fast. </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="which-supplements-do-you-take" class="anchor"></a>Which supplements do you take? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p><em>Mandatory disclaimer</em>: Consult your doctor first and all that. </p>

<p>I like <a href="http://www.musclepharm.com">MusclePharm products</a>. I use Combat (protein), Assault (preworkout), and Recon (postworkout). I also take creatine monohydrate, caffeine, vitamin D, fish oil, ZMA (nightime recovery), and the occasional multivitamin.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="how-has-skeleton-changed-your-life" class="anchor"></a>How has skeleton changed your life? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>In more ways than I could mention. Everything fell into place when I saw skeleton for the first time. Prior to that, I was directionless. I dropped in and out of school, played in a band, and considered pursuing a career as an actor. After seeing skeleton, I didn&rsquo;t need to read about it, or research it, I just knew it was <em>it</em>. </p>

<p>Skeleton pushed me in ways I never expected. It taught me to appreciate hard work, because that&rsquo;s the reward. It allowed me to travel the world. It introduced me to <a href="http://www.morgantracey.us">my girlfriend</a> and two of my <a href="http://www.mattantoine.com">best</a> <a href="http://www.twitter.com/johndalyusa">friends</a>. It gave me <a href="/skeleton/sochi">one of the greatest moments in my life</a>, and enough memories and friendships to last a lifetime. </p>

<p>I also hated to fly. Now, with 20+ flights per year, it&rsquo;s one of my favorite things to do.</p>

    <dd><p>Patience. </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="whats-your-proudest-accomplishment" class="anchor"></a>What's your proudest accomplishment? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Competing in the Olympic Games is the obvious choice. I&rsquo;m also proud of being named the 2005 <a href="http://www.rpmfund.org">Randy Price Memorial Award Winner</a>. I&rsquo;m honored to be a three-time winner of the Athlete&rsquo;s Choice Award. But no one will ever say it better than Olympic Champion Curt Thomasevic:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My proudest accomplishment in bobsled isn’t two Olympic medals. It is knowing that after 10 years, no one can ever question my commitment, my honor, or my character and intentions. I did my best to make myself and my teammates better every day. I had an experience that no one can ever take away. And I don’t need an Olympic medal to remind me of that.</p>
</blockquote>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="what-is-the-combine" class="anchor"></a>What is the combine? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The combine is a standardized test to measure speed, power, and strength of bobsled and skeleton athletes. There are three tiers. If you are a brand new skeleton athlete (tier 1), you will be asked to take three 45m sprints through timing eyes. From the timing data, the coaches will get 15, 30, flying 30, and 45 meter sprint times. Then you will be asked to do an underhand shot toss and a standing broad jump. Your score will be calculated according to a points table.</p>

<p>Most current athletes (Tier 2) also complete a weight room portion, including a 3RM back squat and a 1RM clean.</p>

<p>Tier 3 athletes are those who have competed in an Olympic Games or World Championships in the past two years. Tier 3 athletes don&rsquo;t take a formal combine, but are instead monitored through their strength and conditioning coaches. </p>

    <dt><a name="how-expensive-is-it-to-make-a-track" class="anchor"></a>How expensive is it to build a track? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Modern combined bobsled/skeleton/luge facilities are expensive affairs, costing millions, sometimes <em>hundreds</em> of millions, to build. The Whistler Sliding Centre had a price tag of $105MM CAD, and rumor has it the Sanki Sliding Centre in Sochi cost substantially more. I&rsquo;d love to see more natural tracks  like the one in St. Moritz, Switzerland, but the knowledge and experience to build them is highly specialized. </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="have-you-competed-on-every-track" class="anchor"></a>Have you competed on every track? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Of the tracks still in use, I haven&rsquo;t been to Sigulda, Lillehammer, Paramanovo, and Nagano. I think the Germans slide in Oberhof, but it&rsquo;s not really used otherwise.  </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="which-countries-have-skeleton-tracks" class="anchor"></a>Which countries have skeleton tracks? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>USA, Canada, Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Norway, Japan, Russia, Switzerland, Latvia, and soon Korea.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="how-do-you-train-in-the-winter" class="anchor"></a>How do you train in the winter? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The winter is focused almost entirely on sliding and equipment prep, but we do make time for sprinting and lifting. We travel with a squat rack, weights, and a bench. We make use of local running tracks where we can find them. We lug 10lb bags of protein through airport security. it&rsquo;s not pretty, but it works. </p>

<p>Sliding usually lasts a few hours. We often spend extra time watching athletes from other nations and walking the track, and we have a nightly meeting and video review session. Equipment preparation takes another hour or so. When you factor in time for sports medicine and recovery, the days are pretty full. </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="is-skeleton-easy" class="anchor"></a>Is skeleton easy? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Skeleton is not a easy by any stretch of the imagination. It challenges you mentally and physically. It requires strength and power. It requires skill and experience. It&rsquo;s a technical sport. It&rsquo;s a feeling sport. It&rsquo;s all these things and more. Oh, and it&rsquo;s a damn <em>expensive</em> sport, too. </p>

<p>I think the myth that skeleton is easy comes from an article published by Rick Reilly a few years ago in Sports Illustrated. Rick took a cheap shot at us because he probably saw an easy target. We called him out on it, offered him a chance to come up to Lake Placid and try skeleton for free, courtesy of the United States skeleton team. Not the tourist version of skeleton - but the <em>real</em> sport, from the top of the track - 80 miles per hour, headfirst. Rick definitely got the invite, but we never heard from him. </p>

<p>Rick, the offer still stands. Bring extra pads.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="how-do-i-get-started" class="anchor"></a>How do I get started? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>This is probably the most common question I get, so I wrote a full post about it. In short, you should contact your National Governing Body, which in the US is <em>The United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation</em>. You&rsquo;ll probably sign up for a combine test, and if you do well you&rsquo;ll be invited to Lake Placid for a skeleton school. If you enjoy the sport and the coaches like what they see, you&rsquo;ll enter our development pipeline and be on your way.  </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="whats-it-like-going-90-miles-per-hour-headfirst" class="anchor"></a>What's it like going 90 miles per hour headfirst? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>I imagine it&rsquo;s different for every athlete, but for me it&rsquo;s <em>peaceful</em>. It&rsquo;s a minute of pure focus for my otherwise scattered and ADD brain. For 60 blissful seconds I have absolutely nothing else in the world to worry about. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also exhilirating and addicting, but if you&rsquo;re reading this you probably already knew that. </p>

    <dd><p>I <em>loved</em> my Opening Ceremonies gear, thank you very much! Whenever people gave me crap about it, I took the advice of my friend and former teammate Brad Stewart and simply said, &ldquo;Let me see <em>your</em> Opening Ceremonies sweater!&rdquo;</p>

    <dd><p>Two memories will forever be burned in my brain: Walking into Opening Ceremonies with Matt Antoine and John Daly, and seeing my mom, dad, brother, and <a href="http://www.morgantracey.us">girlfriend</a> waiting for me at the finish line after my final run. It was a very long road to get there, but those two memories made it all worthwhile.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="which-runners-should-i-use" class="anchor"></a>Which runners should I use? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The answer comes with a lot of testing and experience. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to try things that scare you a little bit. Write everything down. You&rsquo;ll build confidence in your equipment and eventually learn to make the right choice 98% of the time. I recommend every skeleton athlete read through <a href="http://www.davenportsleds.ca">Ryan Davenport&rsquo;s website</a> for a thorough introduction to how runners and how specific cuts affect control.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="who-makes-your-sled-and-runners" class="anchor"></a>Who makes your sled and runners? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>I compete on a Willi Schneider sled with Schneider runners. This season I&rsquo;ll be transitioning to a Protostar sled. I have successfully competed on Hass, Davenport, Walser, and Protostar sleds at different points in my career, and found them all to be highly capable. The sled is <em>rarely</em> the limiting factor, and I&rsquo;m skeptical when I hear new athletes complain about bent, slow, or uncompetitive sleds. </p>

<p>Of course I&rsquo;m guilty of this myself. It&rsquo;s hard not to be in a timed sport. But I&rsquo;ve learned more often than not, an expert driver can overcome almost any equipment &ldquo;problem&rdquo;.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="who-makes-the-best-skeleton-equipment" class="anchor"></a>Who makes the best skeleton equipment? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Equipment is largely personal preference so you&rsquo;ll have to experiment. The <em>only</em> sled and runner makers I can personally recommend are Protostar Engineering (not available for sale), Willi Scheider, Richard Bromley, Ryan Davenport, Don Hass, and Andi Walser.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="what-makes-a-great-skeleton-athlete" class="anchor"></a>What makes a great skeleton athlete? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Four things make a great skeleton athlete:</p>

<ol>
<li>A fast start</li>
<li>Good equipment</li>
<li>Mental toughness</li>
<li>Experience</li>
</ol>

<p>You need all four of these things to compete at a high level. I stress to new athletes that <em>experience</em> is often the missing piece of the puzzle. Skeleton requires years of hard work and dedication to master.   </p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="what-were-the-olympics-like" class="anchor"></a>What were the Olympics like? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>The Olympics were an amazing experience. It was my first time competing, so I had nothing else to compare them to. I heard from more experienced Olympians that Sochi didn&rsquo;t really have the atmosphere of other Olympics, but nonetheless I was impressed. </p>

<p>Yes it was warm. I considered that a feature. I was never worried about security, and the measures in place weren&rsquo;t intrusive. Transportation was good and the crowds showed up. </p>

<p>Opening Ceremonies was my favorite part of the experience, because it lived up to the hype. Walking into the Fischt Stadium is something I will never forget. It gives me chills just writing this. Definitlely the highlight of my Games.</p>

    <dt><a name="what-can-you-squat-bench-clean" class="anchor"></a>What can you squat/bench/clean etc? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>My best power clean is 140kg. My best 3RM squat is 170kg. My bench press sucks.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="training-program" class="anchor"></a>What does your training program look like? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Many people don&rsquo;t realize how much training bobsled and skeleton athletes do. My program last several hours every day, 6 days per week. I sprint, lift, recover, eat, and do sport-specific training regularly. Here&rsquo;s a typical summer day for me:</p>

    <dt><a name="will-i-get-hurt" class="anchor"></a>Will I get hurt? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Injuries are a part of sport, but skeleton injuries tend to be less gruesome than people think. We get some cuts and bruises, ice burn, and occasional lower leg injuries from sprinting. Serious injuries are rare. </p>

<p>Rhe most dangerous injury would come from hitting something in the track. That&rsquo;s my biggest fear in the sport. If a skeleton athlete hit something head on at full speed, the outcome would probably be deadly.</p>

    <dt><a name="whats-the-best-body-type-for-skeleton" class="anchor"></a>What's the best body type for skeleton? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>There are many different body types in skeleton, from tall and lean to short and stocky. There&rsquo;s really nothing more sport specific than speed and strength. You&rsquo;ll need both to suceed in skeleton, regardless of body type.</p>

<p>If you can carry some additional body weight without sacrificing speed, you might have an advantage over lighter athletes. But most of the top racers seem to be lighter these days.</p>

    <dt><a name="i-want-to-be-an-olympic-skeleton-athlete-what-do-i-need-to-do" class="anchor"></a>I want to be an Olympic skeleton athlete. What do I need to do? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>Congratulations! Making the decision is the easy part. Now you have to work <em>insanely hard</em> for the next 8&ndash;12 years while sacrificing everything, freezing your ass off, and racking up a bunch of debt. <em>Maybe</em> you&rsquo;ll make the team in 2022.</p>

<p>Qualifying for the Olympics is a long road, and the 2018 team is going to be made up of athletes who are already in our program. There are no <em>wunderkinds</em> waiting to be discovered, who will pick up the sport in four years and compete for an Olympic medal in 2018. It takes years of experience to develop the skill to compete at a high level on every track in the world. </p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get discouraged. Show up, commit, and work hard. Good things will happen if you stick it out.</p>

    <dd><p>I found skeleton by accident. In 2002 during the Salt Lake City Olympics, I clicked a link on the Yahoo! homepage that said &lsquo;Third Generation Olympian Wins Gold in Skeleton&rsquo;. I had no idea what skeleton was, but something about that headline caught my interest. As soon as I saw it, I knew immediately it was for me. I registered for a training camp in the summer, a skeleton school in the winter (in Lake Placid), and after my very first trip down the track I decided to commit to making the Olympic Team. That process took me 12 years, which seems to be about average.</p>

    <dt><a name="are-you-insane" class="anchor"></a>Skeleton? Are you insane? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>No, I&rsquo;m definitely not insane. Skeleton athletes are just a little eccentric. You have to be to enjoy the sport and to be competitive, because there are certainly scary moments. Truthfully skeleton isn&rsquo;t terribly dangerous as long as everyone follows the rules and pays attention. I&rsquo;m more concerned with the things outside of my control than those under my control.</p>

    <dt><a name="have-you-ever-crashed" class="anchor"></a>Have you ever crashed? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>I&rsquo;ve been fortunate. I&rsquo;ve never crashed to the point of losing my sled, but I&rsquo;ve taken some really big hits. The worst have been in Konigssee (out of Kreisel) and Lake Placid (Curve 12).</p>

    <dd><p>I don&rsquo;t <em>hate</em> any of the tracks. They are all fun and unique in their own ways.</p>
</dd>
  
    <dt><a name="whats-your-favorite-track" class="anchor"></a>What's your favorite track? <a href="#">&#8593;</a></dt>
    <dd><p>It&rsquo;s a tie between Lake Placid, NY (my home track) and St. Moritz, Switzerland. I probably have over 2000 runs on Lake Placid, and it&rsquo;s the track on which I learned to slide. </p>

<p>St. Moritz is the only remaining natural track in the world. There&rsquo;s something magical about sliding 1800 meters through the woods on a hand-carved track. It&rsquo;s my best track in Europe, and is tied for my best ever WC performance (5th).</p>
