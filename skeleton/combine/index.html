<p><mark>The combine could be changing in 2014. Information found below is relevant at the moment.</mark></p>

<p>The combine, much like its NFL equivalent, is a series of physical tests meant to measure an athlete&rsquo;s speed, power, strength, and explosiveness. At present, all bobsled and skeleton athletes are required to take the test once per year, usually at the end of the summer near Push Championships. The combine consists of 8 events:</p>

<ul>
<li>15 meter sprint</li>
<li>30 meter sprint</li>
<li>45 meter sprint</li>
<li>Flying 30 meter sprint <sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
<li>Broad Jump</li>
<li>Underhand shot toss</li>
<li>Power Clean</li>
<li>Back Squat</li>
</ul>

<p>Athletes who are interested in getting started in skeleton will likely begin with a combine test in Lake Placid, or at one of the National Recruitment Tours held each summer around the country. The best way to find a testing date and site is to check the <a href="http://www.usbsf.com">United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation website</a>. I&rsquo;m often sent emails asking for the best ways to train for the combine. Focus heavily on sprint training, practice the broad jump (only because you can do it anywhere), and if you can find a shot, spend a few weeks practicing the underhand shot toss. Continue to lift as normal, and at the very least learn the basics of the power clean. There is a chance the lifting portion of the combine will be removed starting in 2014, simply because it is difficult to adminster while traveling. That being said, these are basic movements that will serve you well, and you should learn them. The power clean is more complex and should be learned under the guidance of a coach. If you can&rsquo;t find one, practice on your own as best you can, but don&rsquo;t stress over it. Speed earns more points than lifting in the combine. </p>

<h2>My combine scores</h2>

<p>I enjoy the combine, although I share the sentiments of many teammates in saying that I often feel like I&rsquo;m training for it rather than the upcoming season. Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s a great tool for measuring progress. Here are the last four years of data from my combine. </p>
