## Site Credits

This is my personal website. I almost always design directly in the browser, but sometimes I use [Sketch]() app. The site is powered by [Jekyll](), via the excellent [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com) platform. I host the site on [GitHub Pages](). The domain is registered through [Namecheap](). [Cloudflare]() is the CDN.

Over the years, the site has been powered by many different content management systems including WordPress, ExpressionEngine, Harmony, Kirby, and Statamic. I've settled on Jekyll because I love the speed, security, and simplicity of static websites.

I design the site in the open. You can view the source code on [GitHub](), including experimental branches.

### About the site
I believe personal websites are the autobiographies of the digital age. I author this site mostly for myself, but I try to make the experience enjoyable for visitors. You won't find ads, share buttons, or bloated javascript anywhere on these pages. I believe in clean, minimal code and design.

I have a few simple goals for this site:

- Share my favorite books and their marginalia.
- Share my (occasional) writing.
- Experiment with new designs and techniques.

I don't track visitors or have any analytics. The only metric I care about is how fast the site loads, and how lightweight it is.

I like to make my site useful as well as informative. I built it for me, rather than potential readers, and I try to get the most out of it. I host my [commonplace]() book here.

### Affiliate Links
I sometimes link to books I have read and recommend to people. These are often affiliate links to Amazon.com. I earn a small commission if you buy something after clicking those links. I never recommend a book unless I've read it myself in its entirety, and find it worthwhile or entertaining. Books that I don't recommend don't get affiliate links.

### Privacy
No ads. No analytics. No tracking.
