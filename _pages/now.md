At the moment, I am:

- ~~Moving across the country~~. 
- Training for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games.
- Working for [Instaviser.com](http://www.instaviser.com).
- Building [sledsheet.com](http://www.sledsheet.com).
- Chairing the Athlete Advisory Council of the USABS.
- Reading and recommending books.

I'm often asked to do other things, especially app development and web dev/design. I appreciate the thought, but I have to decline so I can focus on my work. As my priorities change, I'll update this page.

The inspiration for this page came from [Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/now). It's a reminder for me to focus on a few essential things.
