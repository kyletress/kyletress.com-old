  <p>I'm Kyle Tress, an <a href="/skeleton">Olympic skeleton athlete</a> and software developer <a href="http://www.twitter.com/instaviser">@instaviser</a>. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90mph, I like to read, write, and code.</p>

  <article>
    <h1 class="page-header">August 2015</h1>
    <p>I’m sorry.</p>

<p>I just can’t stop reading about space. It must be because I’ve been watching <em><a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-astronaut-wives-club">The Astronaut Wives Club</a></em> on Hulu, based on the <a href="http://amzn.to/1KkZQwZ">New York Times bestselling book</a>. This month I’ve been reading about the Space Race and the <em>Apollo</em> program that launched us into the modern age.</p>

<p>I can think of no greater endeavor than the moon landing. The Apollo Program represents everything unique and wonderful about humanity — our curiosity, ingenuity, resolve, and insatiable desire to push our limits. I’ve learned so much about the men and women who made it happen. I’m excited to share their stories with you this month. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1WZUzPd">The Right Stuff</a></strong> by <em>Tom Wolfe</em></p>

<p>This is the seminal book on the first Americans to conquer space, <em>The Mercury 7</em>. As a skeleton athlete, I love it for the insight Wolfe provides into why these men willingly accepted the enormous risk of their chosen profession, and the mental and physical characteristics that made them the very best. <a href="https://youtu.be/rkoo4Za2Hac">The Academy Award winning film adaptation is on YouTube</a>. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1KkZrKY">A Man on the Moon</a></strong> by <em>Andrew Chaikin</em></p>

<p>This book forms the basis of the excellent Tom Hanks/Ron Howard docudrama <em>From the Earth to the Moon</em>. I read it in 2003 shortly after the Space Shuttle Columbia tragedy, and returned to it this month to remind myself why we do these things. I think <a href="https://youtu.be/g25G1M4EXrQ">President Kennedy said it best</a> in 1962 when he issued his famous challenge. “We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard”. This comprehensive account of <em>Apollo</em> will show you just how hard it was.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1KkZdn9">The Case for Mars</a></strong> by <em>Robert Zubrin</em></p>

<p>After the success of <em>Apollo</em>, what was next? For NASA, the answer was clear: Mars. But declining public interest and congressional budget cuts led to the cancellation of the program. It’s been 45 years, and we haven’t even returned to the moon, let alone Mars. Why?</p>

<p>Zubrin says it’s due to excuses, poor leadership, and lack of direction. In <em>The Case for Mars</em>, he outlines his plan for a manned mission by 2036. More importantly, he argues why we should go. <em>“For the science, for the challenge, for the future”</em>. If an Ares mission to Mars is as successful as Apollo, the benefit will be worth the expense and the risk. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1WZUuel">Elon Musk</a></strong> by <em>Ashlee Vance</em></p>

<p>The excellent website <a href="http://www.waitbutwhy.com">Wait But Why</a> recently concluded a lengthy series of posts on Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal, founder of Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity. Musk not only plans to colonize Mars, he’s <em>actually building the technology to do so</em>. Maybe NASA can’t get it done by 2036, but Musk can. This terrific biography gives us insight into the life and personality of one of the most fascinating people in the world.</p>

<p>As always, please respond and share your thoughts with me. I love to hear about the books you’re reading. Until next month,</p>

<p>Kyle</p>
