  <p>I'm Kyle Tress, an <a href="/skeleton">Olympic skeleton athlete</a> and software developer <a href="http://www.twitter.com/instaviser">@instaviser</a>. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90mph, I like to read, write, and code.</p>

    <h1 class="page-header">November 2015</h1>
    <p>I have decided to take a year off from skeleton racing. After 13 nonstop seasons, I need to give my brain and body a rest before the 2018 Olympics. Now that I have some free time on my hands, I’ll be able to get to some of the books on my “TBR” list, and maybe even turn this tiny newsletter into a weekly podcast. More on that later. Until then, here’s what I’m reading this month. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1XDasZ6">SPQR</a></strong> by <em>Mary Beard</em></p>

<p>Perhaps the oldest surviving acronym in history, SPQR stands for  “<em>The Senate and People of Rome</em>”. This book is an excellent history of Ancient Rome, focused on how an insignificant village morphed into the mighty Roman Empire. I’ve been looking for a book like this for many years - comprehensive but not boring - and Beard has delivered. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1XDawby">The Path to Power</a></strong> by <em>Robert Caro</em></p>

<p>It’s been said of Lyndon Johnson that he never told the truth when a lie would do. Whatever his faults, LBJ understood power - what it is, how to obtain it, and how to use it. This is the first volume of a 5-book, 3000+ page series on his life. I’ll be reading “<em>The Years of Lyndon Johnson</em>” for years to come, but if the first volume is any indication, that’s a good thing. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1PpBQL4">SuperBetter</a></strong> by <em>Jane McGonigal</em></p>

<p>When Jane McGonigal suffered a severe concussion in 2009, she became depressed and unable to work (or even get out of bed). She used her skills as a renowned game designer to turn her recovery into a game. Her system, called <em>SuperBetter</em> (powered by the science of games!) has helped millions of people overcome their own challenges. As someone who enjoys both gaming and racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, this book was just too relevant to pass up. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1PpC19l">The School of Greatness</a></strong> by <em>Lewis Howes</em></p>

<p>I’m usually not a fan of these types of books, but something about this one caught my attention. Lewis is a former Arena Football League player who built a multimillion dollar media company after an injury ended his athletic career. I’m eager to see if this book brings anything new to the <em>live your best life</em> genre. </p>

<p>Next month’s newsletter will be a little different. Instead of sharing new books, I’ll look back over the old newsletters and choose the 3-5 best books I read this year. Also, keep an eye out for my <em>Gift Guide for Readers</em> on December 15th. </p>

<p>I hope some of these books interest you. If not, tell me what you enjoy reading, and which books you’re reading now! See you next month.</p>
