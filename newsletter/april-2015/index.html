  <p>I'm Kyle Tress, an <a href="/skeleton">Olympic skeleton athlete</a> and software developer <a href="http://www.twitter.com/instaviser">@instaviser</a>. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90mph, I like to read, write, and code.</p>

  <article>
    <h1 class="page-header">April 2015</h1>
    <p>I want to thank you for being one of the first subscribers to my recommended reading list. This is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time but couldn’t quite muster the nerve to start. After procrastinating for months, I was reminded of a quote by W.H. Murray (often misattributed to Goethe):  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Too often we let our best ideas wither because we don’t feel ready to share them. I was waiting for the perfect conditions to launch this newsletter into the world, but such conditions don’t exist. They never do. I envisioned myself competing with established players, some of whom have been doing this for years. But as I was recently reminded by <a href="https://www.joshkaufman.net">Josh Kaufman</a>(via his newsletter), “the worst way to climb a ladder is to refuse to move until you find a way to teleport straight to the top”. This is the first rung of a very tall ladder, and I’m honored you chose to climb it with me.</p>

<p>One request before we start. My nascent newsletter could use your help. If you don’t mind, please take a second to forward this to a friend, tweet it, or post it to Facebook. I’d appreciate it.</p>

<p>Now, the books. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1Aike89">His Excellency: George Washington</a></strong> by Joseph Ellis</p>

<p>One of my long term goals is to read a biography of every American president, and His Excellency is a good starting point. Ellis does a commendable job of humanizing George Washington - his tempter, his ambition, his inexperience, his often inexplicable luck - in a way that doesn’t diminish his role as American patriarch. Here Washington is presented with all his foibles, as a man not a myth. Pair with <a href="http://amzn.to/1GJ4xyc">Washington: A Life</a> by Ron Chernow for greater depth. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1KvheLF">Resilience</a></strong> by Eric Greitens</p>

<p>I find it fitting that “Greitens” is often auto-corrected to “Greatness” on my Mac. Eric is a former Navy SEAL, Rhode Scholar, author of the New York Times Bestseller <a href="http://amzn.to/1OG5dst">The Heart and the Fist</a> (also terrific), and potential candidate for Governor of Missouri. Here he offers something reminiscent of Seneca. Resilience is presented as a series of letters between Greitens and a former SEAL teammate who is suffering from PTSD. Like Seneca, this is a book worth dipping into from time to time. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1HZV45W">Where the Sidewalk Ends</a></strong> by Shel Silverstein</p>

<p>“All the magic I have known, I’ve had to make myself”. I loved this book as a kid, and after many years I recently returned to it. I was floored by how much wisdom it contains. If you think Shel only wrote for kids, listen to A Boy Named Sue or check out <a href="http://amzn.to/1Kvn27Q">Uncle Shelby’s ABZ book</a> for more - ahem - adult content.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1QM0GDC">How to Live</a></strong> by Sarah Bakewell</p>

<p>Ostensibly a biography of Michel de Montaigne, this is the rare work that expertly mixes philosophy, history, literary criticism, and more into a beautifully written and compelling whole. Start here then move to <a href="http://amzn.to/1Erscj5">The Essays</a> with a greater appreciation for the founder of the form.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1ErjEbW">The Boys in the Boat</a></strong> by Daniel James Brown</p>

<p>I read this while competing in Germany this season and found it inspiring. The 1936 Olympics in Berlin are one of the most fascinating sporting events in history, and I’m eager to dive into more from that era. But what I loved most about The Boys in the Boat is that the Olympics aren’t the focus. The focus is on the work required to get to there. You’ll know more about rowing than you ever thought possible after reading this book, but the journey is worth it.  </p>

<p><strong>Next month</strong></p>

<p>There are some new releases in May that I’m looking forward to reading, from <a href="http://amzn.to/1GHbCwF">The Wright Brothers</a> by David McCullough to <a href="http://amzn.to/1EEmwUl">The Quartet</a> by Joseph Ellis. It’s going to be a wonderful summer for books. Thanks for reading, and until next time.</p>

<p>Kyle</p>
