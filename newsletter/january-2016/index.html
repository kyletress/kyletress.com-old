    <h1 class="page-header">January 2016</h1>
    <p>Happy 2016! I hope you received (or gave) some great books as gifts over the holidays. I have an intimidating stack of new books that will keep me busy through 2016, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m done buying new books this year. It&rsquo;s important to <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/">build your antilibrary</a>, and I don&rsquo;t feel guilty having unread books on my shelf. I know there is always another great book waiting for me when I finish my current one. Speaking of current reads, here are some books I think you should check out this month. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1PruntH">The Road to Character</a></strong> by <em>David Brooks</em>
Brooks is a New York Times columnist and author of several excellent books like <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Q4Hc9K">The Social Animal</a></em>. His latest work is a detailed look at character, as illuminated through the lives of historical figures like George Marshall, Dorothy Day, A. Philip Randolph, and Dwight Eisenhower. Brooks argues that there are two types of virtues: <em>resume virtues</em> &mdash; the external accomplishments we place on our resumes &mdash; and our deeper, internal <em>eulogy virtues</em> (are we kind, brave, and honest?). Living a life of character demands we prioritize the latter. Brooks believes that the road to character, while difficult (and perhaps never-ending), is one worth walking.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1POoLf7">The Mindful Athlete</a></strong> by <em>George Mumford</em>
Though written for athletes, this book is an excellent introduction to mindfulness in its own right. It&rsquo;s an easy read, perhaps lacking the depth of other books like <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1PrutS4">Mindfulness in Plain English</a></em>. That&rsquo;s not a criticism, but a selling point. It&rsquo;s often difficult to overcome the stigma associated with meditation and mindfulness, despite overwhelming evidence that it&rsquo;s beneficial to our health and performance. Having a guide like George, who has worked with legends such as Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, makes it more palatable. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1POoOHR">The Score Takes Care of Itself</a></strong> by <em>Bill Walsh</em> 
Ryan Holiday, who has <a href="http://ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/">an excellent recommended reading newsletter</a>, chose this book as one of his favorites of 2015. Walsh was a football genius who revolutionized the game and turned the San Francisco 49ers into a dynasty. His creation of the West Coast offense alone would rank him among the greatest coaches ever, but it&rsquo;s his management style that earns him near universal reverence in sport and business. Regardless of your profession, there is much to learn from Bill Walsh, from implementing a <em>Standard of Performance</em> to realizing when you&rsquo;re process-focused instead of outcome-focused, the score really does take care of itself. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1POoUiM">Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words</a></strong> by <em>Randall Munroe</em>
In Thing Explainer, Randall Munroe (creator of <a href="http://xkcd.com">XKCD</a>), describes complicated things like the International Space Station and the U.S Constitution using only the 1000 most common words in the English language. He pairs his hilarious and insightful descriptions with gorgeous, blueprint-style illustrations. This is a book you will pick up again and again, and it will entertain you every time.</p>

<p>This year, I&rsquo;m challenging myself to read 100 books. I&rsquo;d love for you to join me and follow my progress at <a href="http://www.kyletress.com/reading/100-books">www.kyletress.com/reading/100-books</a>. Do you have a reading goal for 2016? If so, I&rsquo;d love to hear about it!</p>

<p>Until next month, </p>

<p>Kyle</p>
