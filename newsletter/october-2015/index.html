  <p>I'm Kyle Tress, an <a href="/skeleton">Olympic skeleton athlete</a> and software developer <a href="http://www.twitter.com/instaviser">@instaviser</a>. When I'm not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90mph, I like to read, write, and code.</p>

    <h1 class="page-header">October 2015</h1>
    <p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku">Tsundoku</a></em> is a Japanese word that means constantly buying books and not reading them. I can identify with this. For every book I finish, it seems like my &lsquo;to be read&rsquo; shelf grows by two. But is that such a bad thing? Not according to Nassim Taleb. In his excellent book <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1N3tSky">The Black Swan</a></em>, Taleb argues that the books you haven’t read are more important than the ones you have:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you do not know as your financial means, mortgage rates, and the currently tight real-estate market will allow you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menacingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This month, I want to share the newest additions to my <em>antilibrary</em>, purchased just yesterday in Utah. I hope to finish a few of these before I land in New York next week. But if I don’t, I’m happy just knowing they’re available on my shelf when the time is right. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1P3OxuB">Mindfulness in Plain English</a></strong> by <em>Bhante Henepola Gunaratana</em></p>

<p>This book comes as a recommendation from one of my favorite blogs, <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com">Farnam Street</a> by Shane Parrish. A recent article called <a href="https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2015/10/attitudes-for-meditation/">The 11 Essential Attitudes for Meditation</a> is derived from the book, and it perfectly captures my skeleton racing philosophy with tenets like <em>Don’t Expect anything</em>, <em>View all problems as challenges</em>, and <em>Let go</em>. This is a great book for anyone interested in mindfulness and meditation. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1M8IUc9">Mindware: Tools for Smart Thinking</a></strong> by <em>Richard E. Nisbett</em></p>

<p>Another Farnam Street recommendation. I’m a sucker for books that teach us how to use tools like math, probability, and statistics to make better decisions and overcome our cognitive biases. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1M8IWRl">Thomas Jefferson: Author of America</a></strong> by <em>Christopher Hitchens</em></p>

<p>I like this book for two reasons. First, I’m an unabashed fan of Hitch, and I think the world is worse off without his sharp (and often controversial) commentary. And second, it’s one self-proclaimed Epicurean writing about another self-proclaimed Epicurean. While it’s not the best Jefferson bio available (I like <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1P3OIGr">Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power</a></em>), it is a quick and enjoyable one.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1P3OGOC">The Secret History</a></strong> by <em>Donna Tartt</em></p>

<p>If the name Donna Tartt sounds familiar, it’s because she recently won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1Hk6QDQ">The Goldfinch</a></em>. <em>The Secret History</em> is her first novel, which I’ve been meaning to read for years but only just purchased in paperback. A murder in an elite Vermont college, centered around the Classics Department? Sold. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://amzn.to/1N3uqXC">Empire of Imagination</a></strong> by <em>Michael Witwer</em></p>

<p>Most people have never heard of Gary Gygax, but if you enjoy video games, fantasy sports, or epic, world-building franchises like Game of Thrones, you have him to thank. Gygax invented the tabletop roleplaying genre with his creation of Dungeons and Dragons in 1974, which subsequently formed the foundation for a ton of pop culture (and inspired generations of writers, actors, comedians, and musicians). This book reveals how Gary’s real life was just as fascinating as the imaginary worlds he created.  This book goes well with <em><a href="http://amzn.to/1N3usi9">Of Dice and Men</a></em> by David M. Ewalt. </p>

<p>With the 2015/2016 Skeleton Team Selection races nearly over, my attention will turn towards books on performance and competition. Next month I hope to share a few of my favorites with you. Until then, happy reading!</p>
