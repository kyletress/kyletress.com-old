</header>

<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Kyle Tress, an Olympic athlete, writer, coder, and futurist. This is <em>Meditations</em>, my personal website, where I write about skeleton, books, and other things that interest me. You can <a href="/credits">learn more about the site here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/kyletress_sochi_getty1-1.jpg" alt="kyletress_sochi_getty1-1"> </p>

<p>In 2002 at the age of 21, I saw the sport of skeleton for the first time. Many years, dollars, and injuries later I&rsquo;m ranked 3rd in the country and 12th in the world. In February 2014, I had the honor of representing the United States at the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. You can read more about that experience on my <a href="/skeleton">skeleton page</a>.</p>

<p>When I&rsquo;m not racing headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour, I enjoy reading, writing, and coding. I believe <code>code</code> is the Lingua Franca of the modern world, and literacy (not fluency), should be taught in every primary school. I occasionally design and develop my own apps, including an iPad app featured by Apple and Creative Arts Magazine.</p>

<p>Coding is a hobby, but writing is a calling. I write 1000 words a day, 6 days per week, a practice I have adhered to for many years.</p>
