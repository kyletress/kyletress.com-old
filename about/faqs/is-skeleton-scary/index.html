<h1>Is skeleton scary?</h1>

</header>

<p>Probably not in the way that most people think. I&rsquo;m never scared to race down the track headfirst at autobahn speeds. Even tracks with notorious reputations, like Whistler or Altenberg, are fun and challenging in a good way. The first run of the season down each track brings some butterflies, but that&rsquo;s normal for most competitors. While there is always the possiblity of injury (or worse), that&rsquo;s true of many sports and life in general.</p>

<p>The things that <em>do</em> scare me are largely outside my control. The scariest scenario for me is probably hitting something in the track. This includes people, animals (it&rsquo;s happened before) or tools that aren&rsquo;t supposed to be there. The time to react to this very small, and a headfirst collision at those speeds can be fatal. </p>

<p>TBI is also a growing area of concern. In light of recent studies and revelations from a few former athletes, I&rsquo;ve begun to wonder about the long term effects of skeleton sliding. Our rides are rarely smooth. There is a lot of vibration, the possibility of concussion, and occasional impact with the ice. Concussions aren&rsquo;t <em>common</em>, but they occur. This is something to keep an eye on.</p>
