Greitens is a Navy SEAL, Rhode Scholar, author of the New York Times Bestseller *The Heart and the Fist*, and candidate for Governor of Missouri. Here he offers something reminiscent of Seneca. Resilience is presented as a series of letters between Greitens and a former SEAL teammate who is suffering from PTSD. Like Seneca, this is a book worth dipping into from time to time.
