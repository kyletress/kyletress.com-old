My favorite book, and one of the greatest ever written. It's ironic since Marcus Aurelius never intended it for publication. The *Meditations*, or *Thoughts to Myself* as it might more accurately be translated, has survived the centuries for good reason. There is something comforting about reading the private thoughts of the most powerful man in the world at the time, as he faces similar problems to the kind we encounter today. A must read for practicing Stoics and those interested in developing an operating system for life.
