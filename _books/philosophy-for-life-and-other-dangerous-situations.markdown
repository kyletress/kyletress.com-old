I learned about Jules Evans through the work of Ryan Holiday. Evans has a terrific website where he teaches *street philosophy* to interested students. It's a practical approach to the field that aims to disrupt its stuffy, academic reputation. *Philosophy for Life* gives readers a comprehensive look at the most enduring ideas from philosophy, which despite being over two thousand years old, can help us navigate the modern world.
