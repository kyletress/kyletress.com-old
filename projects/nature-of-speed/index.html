    <h1 class="page-header">Nature of Speed</h1>
    <p>Nature of Speed is an athlete testing and monitoring app. I built a proof of concept MVP for the company in Ruby on Rails, as well as a customer facing site in Wordpress.  </p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Nature of Speed uses a proprietary testing protocol to measure rate of force development in specific positions and time intervals for athletes in a variety of sports. The company was using Google Docs to store and analyze the data when I suggested a custom app and database as a better long term solution. I built the app prototype in a weekend, and spent several days designing and developing the custom WordPress theme.   </p>

<h2>The App</h2>

<p>Logins are restricted to partner facilities. A facility can request approval on the login page, which sends an email to the administrators. They can grant approval in the app. Data collected during testing is manually entered into the app. Each athlete has a profile page with all their tests in one location.</p>

<h2>The Customer Site</h2>

<p>I wanted to keep the design of the site clean and simple, with a headline that explained the basics of Nature of Speed in less than six words. After a lot of debate we finally settled on <em>We build better athletes through science</em>. I included a testimonial as well as a brief bio of the founder, Dr. Brad Deweese. I implemented the site design and blog into a custom Wordpress theme. </p>
