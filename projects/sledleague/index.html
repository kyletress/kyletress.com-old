<p>SledLeague is a fantasy sports prediction app for Bobsled/Skeleton that is currently in development. I am building the app in Ruby on Rails, and I am responsible for its design, development, and maintenance. The <a href="http://www.github.com/kyletress/sledleague">source code</a> is on GitHub. </p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>One of my first Ruby on Rails apps when I was learning the framework was a fantasy Formula One game. I knew that I wanted to create a similar game for the sports of bobsled and skeleton, but at the time the app was too ambitious. I finally returned to the idea in 2013. </p>

<h2>The App</h2>

<p>SledLeague has a simple premise. A user predicts the top finishers for a race, and they are awarded points for how close their predictions are to the final result. But that simplicity hides a lot of complexity and functionality, from the difficulty of managing timezones to league-specific rule sets. </p>

<h2>Technology and Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Private and public leagues</li>
<li>League specific rules and race selections</li>
<li>Integration with <a href="http://www.sendgrid.com">SendGrid</a> to deliver weekly updates on the status of your league. </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>I intend to integrate SledLeague with the <a href="/projects/sledsheet">Sledsheet API</a> in order to get final results into the app for point calculation. Iâ€™d also like to create a mobile app so users can manage their predictions on the go.</p>
