=============

The source code for my personal website [kyletress.com](http://www.kyletress.com). I believe personal websites are the autobiographies of the digital age, and should reflect their owner's personality. I wanted a site that was simple, minimal, and static. The site is powered by [Siteleaf](http://www.siteleaf.com) and hosted on GitHub Pages. I use CloudFlare as my CDN.

### Publishing
1. Push source to GitHub.
2. Push theme to Siteleaf.
3. Publish site on Siteleaf.
4. Purge cache on CloudFlare.
