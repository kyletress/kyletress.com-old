      <p>I recently finished <a href="http://amzn.com/0812979370">The Social Animal</a> by David Brooks. Among many great passages, one in particular stuck with me. Brooks explains that as we age, we are less open to new experiences. As a result our days tend to blend together, making the passage of time seem quick and cruel. Children experience this process in reverse. Every day offers new experiences, filled with new possibilities and new challenges. For them, the passage of time seems to move slowly, to which any kid will attest on Christmas Eve. The conclusion is fascinating. If we want to experience the passage of time more slowly, we need to fill our days with unique experiences, and live as though we are new to the world.</p>

<p>Looking back over the past decade, I’m lucky to have found my own unique experience. At age 21 I was directionless, and wandered into the sport of skeleton. Had I not, I probably would have ended up working a job I hated, or majoring in a field in which I was barely interested. Instead I’ve traveled the world, met great friends, and raced at the highest levels of sport. It’s been a great gift for which I’m thankful.</p>

<p>Not that it was all great. I wasted a lot of time on dumb ideas. I pursued meaningless things. I probably never had a single original thought. But that is expected of 20-somethings. It’s a time to make mistakes, take risks, and chase dreams. Enjoy it now, some say, because 30 is around the corner. That’s when it gets serious, right? </p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Each new year is a chance to explore, to make mistakes, to take risks, and to try new things. Life will always be chaotic - from kids to mortgages, bills to responsibilities. However that’s not an excuse to stop pushing. If I’ve learned anything from training for the Olympics, it’s this - The moment you stop pushing is the moment you lose. <em>If you slow down, you go down</em>.</p>

<p>I plan on pushing all the way to the ripe old age of 200. If you don’t believe that’s possible, consider this. The average lifespan in 1900 was about 47. Today, it’s over 80. By 2040, advances in biotech and nanotech will push that number past 120. I might have only lived 1/7 of my potential lifespan so far. It’s probably the reason why I sometimes act like I’m 12.</p>

<p>Today I’m entering the next decade of my life quietly, because 30 is just another year to explore, create, play, mess up, learn, and change. If I’m lucky, I’ll have 170 more years to do the same.</p>
