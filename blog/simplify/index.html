      <p>I&rsquo;m a terrible minimalist. I really do wish I was better. I often find myself browsing various minimalist websites, dripping with envy over the people who cut down their belongings to 100 items or fewer. Better yet, those that manage to pack their entire lives in a carry on bag and travel the world for months (or years) at a time. Meanwhile I&rsquo;m facing my own personal Hydra. No matter how hard I try, it seems for every one thing I remove, three more appear. Do I really need two helmet cameras? What if I want to shoot something in 3D? Better keep both. Oh, and I&rsquo;ll buy a case for them while I&rsquo;m at it.</p>

<p>My skeleton equipment is another great example. I have runners from the early &lsquo;90&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m pretty sure would kill me if I tried them in Lake Placid. Who knows what kind of metal they are made from, but it&rsquo;s pre-standardization. They are so shiny I swear I can see back in time when I look at them. Will I ever use them? No. Could I sell them? Probably not. Maybe they could have a home in the kit of an ice fisherman, who apparently buy used skeleton runners to haul gear. Who knew there was an after market for this junk? Maybe I&rsquo;ll ask around and see if I can find a buyer. Nah, on second thought I&rsquo;ll play Xbox. Or maybe Wii. Hell, I&rsquo;m sure I can scrounge up an old DreamCast around here somewhere.</p>

<p>So those runners will remain in my closet, along with countless other things I no longer want or need. I tend to form strong attachments to certain objects and I have a hard time letting them go, a typical Aspersger symptom. Yet it doesn&rsquo;t diminish the appeal of minimalism. I&rsquo;m working to incorporate more of the philosophy into my life and sport. Like so many things, it&rsquo;s useful in both. Who hasn&rsquo;t become overwhelmed by equipment, or coaching, or racing over the course of an athletic career ? What&rsquo;s worse is that it&rsquo;s a vicious circle. It&rsquo;s human nature to seek more of the things we think we need, more equipment, more coaching, more racing, when the real solution might very well be less.</p>

<p>So with that I&rsquo;m simplifying. I&rsquo;m starting here on my website, cutting excess junk and focusing more on the things I enjoy writing about and less on the things I don&rsquo;t. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t delete any of those old things. They are just sitting in my closet, collecting dust, waiting for a fisherman to pass by.</p>
