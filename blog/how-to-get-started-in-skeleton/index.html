    <p>One of the most frequent questions I get asked is “How do I get started in skeleton”? If you’ve ever had the desire to slide headfirst down an ice track at 85mph with your chin two inches from the ice, this is the post for you! I’m going to cover your first year of sliding in brilliant High-Definition in this long-winded, Red Bull fueled post. While this article is written for athletes in the US, much of it is relevant to international sliders. I’ve included a few country-specific details at the bottom just to be sure. Let’s get started.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> I’m putting important stuff in these boxes. If you want to skim this post, this is the stuff to read. For the über lazy, you can also contact me if you have questions.</p>

<h2>How I did it</h2>

<p>I began sliding in November 2002 after watching skeleton in the Salt Lake City games. The success of the American sliding program in bobsled and skeleton put sliding back on the radar. As a result, there were nationwide recruitment camps that summer. In June, I attended one in Towson, Maryland where I was joined by 20 other hopefuls and coaches from the US Bobsled and Skeleton Federation. Following a 4-item test (30m sprint, 30m fly, vertical jump, and 5-hop test), we were told that a small group would be contacted later in the summer and invited to Lake Placid for a driver’s school in November. A few months later, I was on my way to the Olympic Training Center for the first time. My first run down the track was incredible. I’ll never forget the cold, the nerves, the lack of instructions before I was kicked down the start ramp. When I got off the track after that first run, I immediately decided I was going to dedicate myself to making the team. I didn’t realize how much of a life-changing decision and commitment it would be at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #1:</strong> It takes <em>at least</em> 8 years of dedicated training to reach a world class level in skeleton. Anyone who tells you different is lying, or wants to sell you equipment.</p>

<h2>How it’s done now</h2>

<p>A lot has changed since the 2002. The summer recruitment tour is gone, and in fact we now do very little recruiting at all. If you have any interest in skeleton, <em>I strongly recommend</em> you contact the <a href="http://bobsled.teamusa.org">United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation</a> at 1-800-BOBSLED and ask about upcoming fantasy and development camps. Also find out how to submit your athletic resume (You have one, right?). Ideal skeleton candidates usually have a track and field background, with a quick 30m time and a solid vertical leap. Don’t be discouraged if your high school athletic career consisted of a few rounds of golf and a half-hearted attempt at a 5K (mine did). Driving a skeleton sled is a skill you will develop with practice. Despite my non-sprinting background, I became one of the fastest pushers in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #2&lt;</strong> For long term success in skeleton, you must have a fast start. Start sprinting and lifting <em>before</em> you come to camp</p>

<p>If you meet the qualifications (or have money to burn in the case of a fantasy camp) you’ll be invited to Lake Placid or Park City for a sliding school and your first trip down an artificially cooled, mile-long chute of terror — The Combined Bobsleigh, Skeleton, and Luge Track™</p>

<h2>Did that. Now what?</h2>

<p>Here comes the sticker shock. My first camp in Lake Placid cost $500. I’ve heard that price is closer to $2000 now. It’s a steep price, but your housing and food are covered at the Olympic Training Center, and all the equipment will be provided (with the exception of ski goggles and track spikes). You’ll get several runs on the track and by the end of the week you will make your way to Start One. Looking down the start ramp into Curve One for the first time will really test your nerves and your commitment. If you stick around long enough and show some potential, you’ll be invited back for a longer stay and could qualify for the Elite Development Team. If you do, you’ll have housing, food, and track time covered for the rest of the season so you can focus on sliding and improving. if you don’t qualify for the Elite Development Team you can still slide, but you might have to pay for it. The prices seem to increase every season so you’ll have to ask at the conclusion of your sliding school.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #3</strong> Skeleton isn’t for everyone. For some, the reality of standing at the top looking down the start ramp is too much. I’ve seen grown men sneak out in the middle of the night, never to return (true story). I’ve also seen a few nasty crashes. It’s an inherently dangerous sport. If you don’t think you have it in you, you probably don’t.</p>

<h2>The Good Life</h2>

<p>Congratulations! If you’ve made it this far, you’re ready to join a unique community. As a new initiate, you will (lovingly) be referred to as a ‘nugget’. You will get sold crappy, second-hand equipment. You’ll have a very hard time getting a straight answer to anything. You’ll freeze your ass off in -20F weather while cursing whoever put this stupid idea into your head (hopefully not me). Welcome to sliding. It’s as wonderful as it is terrible, as thrilling as it is monotonous, but there is <em>absolutely nothing like it in the world</em>. Take as many runs per day as you can. Write down everything you remember about each one. Keep your time sheets (you’ll want them later) but don’t obsess over times. Feel and listen to the sled beneath you as you glide down the track. Absorb as much information as you can from the more experienced athletes around you. Don’t be afraid to ask questions, but don’t expect all the answers. You, like all the sliders before you, will have to figure some things out on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #4:</strong> Don&rsquo;t be a jerk. You have a long road ahead, and you&rsquo;ll need help from the experienced sliders. You aren&rsquo;t going to the Olympics in four years, and probably not in 8 years, either. Be kind, learn every day, and it can happen. </p>

<p>During this time you might start to think about purchasing equipment. My advice is to wait. Skeleton equipment is horrendously overpriced. Used sleds often go for $8000. Runners are $1000/set. Helmet? $500. Skeleton spikes? $250. You have your entire career to chase the Next Best Sled ™ or to plunk down the GDP of a small pacific rim country on a set of questionable runners. But it’s not now. It’s next season, when (if?) you return to Lake Placid. If you have to buy something, get a cheap speed suit or a nice helmet.</p>

<p><strong>Rule #5</strong> Skeleton is expensive. Be prepared to spend $10,000 or more per season.</p>

<h2>Regional Championships</h2>

<p>At the end of every season, Lake Placid and Park City both host a Regional Championship race to qualify “new” sliders into Team Trials the following year. I say “new”, because you often have to race against experienced athletes who are returning from a year off, returning from an injury, or didn’t pre-qualify during the season. The top 2 or 3 athletes from each track will go on to Team Trials, while the rest will continue on the development tour for another season. It’s great to watch a brand new slider qualify for team trials, but it’s rare (not as much on the women’s side). Even if you don’t get the team trials spot, you can still forerun the event in October, gaining valuable experience.</p>

<h2>Team Trials and Beyond</h2>

<p>When you finally qualify for team trials, you’ll be competing against Olympians, World Champions, World Cup, Intercontinental Cup, and AC/EC sliders. It can be a real downer to come this far and find yourself getting beat by 3 seconds. We’ve all been there and it’s an important part of the learning curve. The level of competition you face at Trials will prepare you once you earn a spot on the America’s Cup tour and start traveling, but I’ll cover that in a different post.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Rule #6</strong> This community is amazing. Meet people, ask questions, and make friends around the world. Skeleton is worth the cost of admission.</p>

<h2>West Coast athletes</h2>

<p>There are probably more opportunities to get involved in a club or development team out in Park City. You should contact the <a href="http://www.olyparks.com">Utah Olympic Park</a> to learn more about their programs. A word of warning: In my experience it is <em>very expensive</em> to get a season pass and slide full time in Park City <em>unless</em> you live there. If you are planning on sliding for the entire season, it’s probably cheaper and more beneficial to start out in Lake Placid and stay at the Olympic Training Center.</p>

<h2>International athletes</h2>

<p>I wish I could be more helpful, but the best way to get started is to contact your national federation. You can find a list of all the governing bodies on <a href="http://www.fibt.com">FIBT.com</a>. The FIBT also hosts schools once or twice a season for new athletes with some great coaching. In fact there is one coming up this April in Lake Placid. I’m not sure if that will be available to new athletes, but it might be worth sending a quick email to the FIBT or your Governing body to find out. As a side note, remember what I said in rule #1? It doesn’t always apply internationally. There are talented, athletic sliders making it to the World Cup level in 2 or 3 seasons. Disclaimer — Your results may differ.</p>

<h2>See you on the track</h2>

<p>While it may seem like a lot of work just to get started, the truth is it’s actually pretty easy (albeit expensive) to get involved. If you love sliding, this process will seem effortless.
