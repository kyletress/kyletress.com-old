      <p>Tonight was my first night back on the ice in nearly a month. It felt great to be sliding once again, and even though the track was covered with snow and the times were slow, it made me realize how much I love this sport. In this two-part series I&rsquo;m going to talk about the six things I love about skeleton. Don&rsquo;t forget, you can also <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kyletress">follow me on twitter</a>!</p>

<h2>Traveling</h2>

<p>I got my first passport when I was 12 years old. I remember flipping through the blank pages and hoping that one day it would be filled with stamps from locations around the world. There was little doubt that traveling would play a large role in my life, but being on the skeleton team has given me opportunities to meet people from other countries and learn far more about their culture and customs than I could on my own.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that traveling can get repetitive, especially when you visit the same locations over and over. I try to remember that each place has far more history than I could ever cover in my lifetime, regardless of how long I spend there. I also try to branch out to nearby towns, villages, and cities. When we compete in Altenberg, Germany, we can visit Prague which is only an hour away by car. In Konigssee, Germany, we can drive to Salzburg in thirty minutes. During one epic 14-hour trip, <a href="http://www.slidingdreams.com">Caleb Smith</a> and I once traveled from St. Moritz, Switzerland to the Matterhorn. We spent an hour at the mountain, turned around and came home.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m already planning on visiting a few new locations next winter, and I&rsquo;m hoping the schedule includes a few tracks I&rsquo;ve never been to (such as Latvia, Japan, or Russia). I&rsquo;m really very lucky to travel like I do, despite having to occasionally fly through some bad weather.</p>

<h2>The People</h2>

<p>We have one of the <em>best communities</em> in sport. Ok, that might be a bit of an overstatement. But truthfully, in what other sport will you find doctors and lawyers, auctioneers and engineers, designers, writers, pilots, bankers, musicians, physicists, oil tycoons, TV executives, stunt men, actors, entrepreneurs, and every other profession under the sun united by a childhood desire to slide down a hill faster than everyone else? I believe that of all the Olympic sports, skeleton attracts the most interesting people. It also attracts <em>genuinely good</em> people. I&rsquo;ve made amazing friends, not only in the US, but from countries around the world. These friendships will last much longer than my racing career. </p>

<h2>The Competition</h2>

<p>There is a lot to be said for competing against your friends and teammates. Skeleton is an individual sport even though we race together as a country. I played only a few sports in high school and college, and none of them longer than a season. I&rsquo;ve had to develop a love of competition along the way and it wasn&rsquo;t easy. Several times I&rsquo;ve thought that I don&rsquo;t have the competitive spirit to continue racing.</p>

<p>Thankfully I know this is no longer true. The feeling I get during a race, when I&rsquo;m standing on the start line looking down the track into curve one, is addicting. I know that I&rsquo;m surrounded by dozens of athletes that want to win just as badly as I do. The realization that I&rsquo;m my only true competitor on the track helps calm me down and keep me focused. I&rsquo;m sure athletes have known this for years, but I&rsquo;m just starting to realize it.</p>

<h2>Speed</h2>

<p>No surprise here. Skeleton athletes are addicted to the speed and adrenaline of sliding down the track at 85mph. No matter how many runs we take, it never gets old. With every new track comes a new experience. Speeding through the trees in St. Moritz is completely different from cruising through low point in Park City. I&rsquo;m excited to get on the track in Vancouver just to see how fast it truly is.</p>

<p>Skeleton becomes somewhat of an addiction, and I think that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so hard for people to walk away from the sport. It might be the right time for them to do so, but what could ever replace the adrenaline rush that comes from sliding headfirst down an ice track at 90mph? When I finally decide to call it quits, I think I might have to find a new hobby. The <a href="http://www.rocketracingleague.com">Rocket Racing League</a> sounds kind of interesting.</p>

<h2>The Olympics</h2>

<p>I remember watching the 1994 Olympics in Lillihammer and deciding that I was going to be a speedskater. Shortly after, my mom and I signed up for ice skating lessons, and every saturday we would drive to <a href="http://www.ice-land.com/">Ice Land</a> in Hamilton, NJ. My Olympic dream was born on that rink, and although my career path has shifted, the desire has never been stronger. I&rsquo;m both disappointed and grateful that I didn&rsquo;t make the team in Vancouver. Watching these Olympics has reminded me how much this dream means to me. I somehow lost track of that along the way.</p>

<p>I often wonder how many people would be compete in skeleton if it wasn&rsquo;t in the Olympics. I like to think I would be one of them. I love the simplicity and naturalness of the sport. I also find it a bit eccentric, which makes me quite happy. Not many people can write <em>Professional Sledder</em> on their resume.</p>

<h2>My  team</h2>

<p>When it&rsquo;s -20F and I&rsquo;m stranded in a blizzard in Germany, sleeping in a hotel formerly called the Sport Prison, it&rsquo;s easy to become discouraged and forget why I&rsquo;m doing this. We don&#8217;t get large sponsorship checks or endorsement deals. You won&rsquo;t often see us on Sports Center. No one cares who won the latest World Cup, or World Championships. But every once in a while, I&rsquo;ll get a letter, an email, a phone call, or a word or two of encouragement from a friend. It reminds me that what I&rsquo;m trying to accomplish really does matter. It matters to my parents who have sacrificed so much to get me here. It matters to my friends who encourage me to never give up. It matters to my fans and supporters who continuously donate their time, money, and energy to my success. I want this not just for myself, but for them.</p>

<h2>Thank you</h2>

<p>Thanks so much for continuing to read my blog. I can&rsquo;t express how much that means to me. If you like what I&rsquo;m doing, <a href="/donate">donate a small amount</a> to keep me going! Those donations keep me training, writing, and sliding. Also be sure to check out part two of this series, where I talk about the things I hate about skeleton. I&rsquo;m sure it will get me a few angry emails. Until then, happy sliding!</p>
