      <p>My 25 hour, 3 flight, 5500 mile journey back to the United States is set to begin at 1:50am tonight. The 2014 Olympics have been an incredible experience filled with memories I’ll cherish forever, but I’m ready to be home. We’ve been traveling since late October, From Lake Placid to Park City to Sochi and back. Following a brief stint home for Christmas, we departed for Europe on December 28th and we’ve been on the road ever since. That kind of traveling, compounded by the stress of competition and Olympic qualification, has taken its toll. I expect to sleep for days when I finally reach New Jersey late tomorrow evening.</p>

<p>I’m still processing everything that happened here. As I’ve mentioned, the result was disappointing and well off what I expected, but there is so much positivity to take out of the experience. I am returning to off season training with new ideas, a better outlook on sliding, and renewed sense of purpose and vigor heading into the new quad.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate my teammates, not just Matt, John, Noelle, and Katie, but the bobsled team as well. We are the most successful federation in Sochi, with 6 overall medals (one in each discipline!). Unfortunately, we don’t have a team event, relay race, or multiple chances to earn a medal. We have to be on for four runs over two days, and often the tiniest mistakes can take us out of contention. Despite these challenges on a foreign track, we had our most successful Olympic Games since 2002. It bodes well for our sport, our federation, our funding, and our future. I’m confident that the next four years will bring more of the same.</p>
