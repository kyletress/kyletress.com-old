<p>Before you read this essay and purchase a sled, you should take a look at <a href="/essays/how-to-get-started-in-skeleton">getting started in skeleton</a>.</p>

<h2>How much does a sled cost?</h2>

<p>Sleds typically range from $3000 for a good beginner sled to $10,000 and up for higher-end models. My first sled cost $2000, and was built by U.S. development coach Don Hass. Today I&#8217;m racing on a sled from Swiss builder Andy Walser, purchased in 2009 for 4200 euro. <a href="http://www.davenportsleds.ca">Ryan Davenport</a>, one of the most prominent sled builders in the world charges $3500 CAD but he&rsquo;s currently taking a hiatus. His used sleds are now fetching considerably higher prices ($7000 USD, including mine which is <a href="/contact">currently for sale</a>). The point is you&#8217;ll find a wide range of prices which can be intimidating to new sliders. I hope I can offer some clear advice to help you make the right decision for your needs.</p>

<h2>What do I need and how much should I spend?</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ll discuss other gear in a later post, but for now let&#8217;s focus on your sled and runners. As a new slider, you&rsquo;ll need an FIBT legal sled, along with a set of FIBT runners. Nearly all sleds are legal if you go with an established builder (see list below). If you choose to go your own route, I can&rsquo;t offer much advice. Sleds are basic by design but there are some obscure rules that might ground your homebuilt masterpiece before it ever sees Curve One. A few seasons ago a guy came to Lake Placid with a flexible flyer sled, with runners bolted on the bottom. He was kicked off the track and never invited back. I can&rsquo;t make this stuff up.</p>

<p><strong>The FIBT:</strong> The Federation of International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing, our international governing body. They make the rules, enforce the rules, and keep us in business.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you buy new or used, I&#8217;d budget $4000 for your first sled and runners. You might score a deal and pay less, but this is a good starting point.</p>

<h2>New or Used?</h2>

<p>Ah, the great debate. There are positives and negatives to both, but ultimately it <em>just doesn&#8217;t matter</em>. My first sled was new, my second and third sleds were used. I liked sliding on all of them. Just find something you&#8217;re comfortable with and go for it. If you live near a sled builder, send an email and see what they&#8217;re offering. If you know an experienced slider, ask their opinion and find out what&#8217;s on the market. If you are in a development program, ask your coach for a recommendation. Remember that the resale value of sleds is pretty high, so chances are good that if you don&#8217;t like the sled someone else will.</p>

<h2>Tips and tricks for buying sleds</h2>

<p>It is a reality of the sport that <em>used</em> equipment sometimes costs more than <em>new</em> equipment. You&rsquo;ll hear people talk about selling a fast sled, or a sled that won ;such-and-such race in 1889. I generally dismiss this as promotional bullshit. One exception to this rule are sleds built by Davenport. Ryan has a reputation for making great sleds and runners, but he&rsquo;s not currently building equipment. Expect to pay a premium for his gear. Besides that, here&rsquo;s my checklist for new sleds:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find an experience slider with the same sled builder and ask their opinion.</li>
<li>Does the price include shipping? I paid an additional $800 to ship my sled from Switzerland to New Jersey.</li>
<li>Does the sled includes tape, padding, and tools?</li>
<li>Ask about the repair policy. Some athletes have purchased a $3000 sled only to be charge a fortune for repairs.</li>
<li>Make sure your builder is easy to contact. This can be a challenge with international builders</li>
<li>Get fit for the saddle in person. If this is not possible, send detailed measurements.</li>
<li>Ask if the sled comes with weight plates.</li>
</ul>

<p>And my checklist for used sleds:</p>

<ul>
<li>Try the sled first. You break it, you buy it.</li>
<li>Ask about the history of the sled. Who was the original owner? How old is it? Were any modifications made?</li>
<li>Open the sled up and check the welds, the bolts, and the pod for damage.</li>
<li>Ask if the sled includes weight plates</li>
<li>Flex the sled to see how it moves. Is it loose or stiff? Does it snap back to a neutral position when you let go?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Builders I recommend</h2>

<p>Here is a list of current sled builders.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.walser-cycles.ch/">Andy Walser</a> - Switzerland. My current builder. Great equipment, but expensive to ship to the USA.</li>
<li>Don Hass - Lake Placid, New York. Don built my first sled and he continues to make good stuff. Great option if you are located on the East Coast.</li>
<li>Randy Parker - No. I advise against buying anything<br></li>
</ul>

<p>Did I miss someone? <a href="/contact">contact me</a> and I&rsquo;ll add to the list.</p>

<h2>Get sliding</h2>

<p>New sleds take a while to break in and there is a definite adjustment period any time you switch equipment &mdash; get sliding! Take pride in your new sled and treat it well. Give it a name. Buy a cover for it. Blow dry the rain and snow out of it when you come home from sliding. Remember that it takes you safely to the bottom of a mile-long ice track in less than sixty seconds. It deserves your respect!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and happy sliding.</p>
