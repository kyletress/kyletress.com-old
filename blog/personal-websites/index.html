      <p>A new season is almost here, and with it a new site design. My website has changed so much over the last 10 years it&rsquo;s barely recognizable from the place it was in 2002. I&rsquo;ve adopted and abandoned just about every major platform, content management system, framework, and web service. I&rsquo;ve spent countless hours creating and destroying the code and pixels that make it all work. It wasn&rsquo;t time wasted. If anything, a personal website is a place to experiment with ideas and technology. It&rsquo;s like a training run leading up to race day. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be perfect, but you better make damn sure you learn something.  </p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned that I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy with a skeleton specific website. I have too many interests and opinions I want to share. I want to write about skeleton of course, but also about the web, humanism, training, singularity, space, Apple, and much more. That might alienate some readers, who are left wondering &ldquo;who the hell cares about Mars? When is the next World Cup?&rdquo;. However I&rsquo;ve decided I want to put the <em>personal</em> back into my personal website.</p>

<h2>Personal Websites</h2>

<p>Having a home on the web is about so much more than just blogging or sharing results (if you&rsquo;re an athlete). It&rsquo;s a digital hub, a personal archive, a place of self expression, and if treated properly it can be a platform for getting your ideas into the world. Last May I wrote an article about <a href="http://www.kyletress.com/2011/05/be-a-quiet-professional/">being a quiet professional</a> that was viewed over 30,000 times. The power of that number still shocks me, especially for an article I wrote in 15 minutes with zero expectations. That tiny glimpse into my personality continues to attract readers and it will forever. </p>

<p>Furthermore a personal website is an opportunity to control the first thing prospective fans, employers, and the press learn about you on the web. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why it&rsquo;s so important to own YourName.com. Not only is it your digital identity, but it is a chance to own the <em>top Google search result</em> for your name. The importance of this cannot be overstated. The top Google result gets nearly 35% of clicks. I want those clicks to stop by my house first, where I control the message and how it&rsquo;s presented. </p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<p>An important part of building any website is deciding what the goals are. My goal is to build a permanent home on the web to share and archive important things in my life. Many of us use apps like Facebook and Twitter for this purpose, but they alone are not sufficient to build a presence on the web, particularly for athletes. Content posted there is too fleeting, too impermanent, and for all intents and purposes inaccessible once it has drifted downstream. With almost 800 million users, Facebook seems too big to fail (haven&rsquo;t we heard that before?), but as we saw with MySpace it&rsquo;s possible. What happens to our data then?</p>

<p>When I built the first version of this site in 2002, Facebook didn&rsquo;t exist. With the exception of GeoCities the only way to have a permanent presence on the web was to build it yourself. Times have changed. Today it&rsquo;s incredibly easy to start a blog or build a personal landing page. Want to quickly share photos? Instagram. Want to make a movie? YouTube.  We are creating and sharing content across so many channels that it&rsquo;s becoming difficult to keep track of what is truly ours, and what is hidden behind the walled garden of some shiny new web service. </p>

<p>As easy as it is to create and share content on social networks, I second guess myself a lot when it comes to pushing the post button, mostly for fear of judgement. I find myself wondering, &ldquo;Do 500 of my friends <em>really</em> want to read this?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s worse on Twitter. 6 straight tweets in a row and I feel like I&rsquo;m spamming the hell out of my friends. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I love and use both services, but they can&rsquo;t provide the sense of ownership and control I want over my content and how it&rsquo;s presented. Here I can build, design, and decorate however I want, and change it as often as I like. If this is my home, then Facebook et al. are like great vacation spots I visit to get away from things for a while. They are fun to check out, but it always feels good to return home. After all, what happens in Facebook, stays in Facebook. </p>

<p>For fear of sounding like some old neck-bearded computer scientist trumpeting the evils of social networks, let me reiterate. I love these services and I&rsquo;m not interested in giving up the great social features they offer. But they are just a small piece of my content strategy. I use them, but I don&rsquo;t expect any level of permanency from them. Anything worthy of keeping and sharing will be posted here first, and made available forever.</p>

<h3>Content Strategy</h3>

<p>Besides posting personal articles and photos here, I have a <a href="http://kyletress.tumblr.com">Tumblr account</a> and a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/kyletress">Twitter account</a> you should check out. For me these sites are about sharing content, not creating it. I have a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/KyleTressSkeleton">Facebook fan page</a> I&rsquo;ll use primarily to interact with my skeleton fan base. I set up a personal landing page at <a href="http://www.tress.me"><a href="http://www.tress.me">www.tress.me</a></a> that pulls in and displays content from across my personal network. Finally, I&rsquo;ll be using services like Instagram, FourSquare, and YouTube mostly for fun. As much as possible, I&rsquo;ll be pulling data from all of these services into this site, which will act as the main hub of my digital life.    </p>

<p>I believe there is value in this strategy for many people. It&rsquo;s obvious that every athlete needs a website (and an iPad, but that&rsquo;s another post). Over the coming weeks I&rsquo;ll be writing more about new media strategies for athletes. Expect to see topics about building a platform, attracting a fan base, using social media, and blogging.</p>
