      <p>Every year I try to read 60 books, ranging from history to programming, religion to fantasy and sci-fi. I&rsquo;m a fast reader and often finish books in a single sitting (technical books excluded). Here are the books I&rsquo;m hoping to finish this summer.</p>

<li>A Feast for Crows. Completed.</li>
<li>A Dance with Dragons. Completed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts on the selections. </p>

<p>A Song of Ice and Fire has been consistently keeping me up until 2am. If you watch the television show, you will probably enjoy the books. It&rsquo;s like having the next 6 seasons available RIGHT NOW! You&rsquo;ll be in for some work though. The cast of characters number in the thousands, as does the page count. </p>

<p>I read Film School in one sitting. Going to USC Film School is a dream of mine. Steve Bowman did it at the age of 40, and he sold a television show to CBS in the process. Engaging. </p>

<p>App Empire and The Art of the App Store are must-reads if you want to own an app business. To be better at my own app business, I&rsquo;m teaching myself to write iPhone and iPad apps. Programming in Objective-C and iOS Programming are the two must have books on the subject. Both are surprisingly readable. </p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the 100th anniversary of the sinking of R.M.S. Titanic and it&rsquo;s still a fascinating subject. Discovery Channel had it well covered in April but a Night to Remember has depth and scope unlike anything seen on TV. </p>

<p>I always try to read a few books in the religion/atheism/skepticism/humanism genre. Why are you Atheists So Angry is a hilarious take on the subject and beautifully written. </p>

<p>Dr. Dan Roling recommended the Power of Habit. Looking forward to reading this one as we get closer to the start of the season.</p>
