      <p>In short &mdash; absolutely. It was the right journalistic decision. I&rsquo;ve heard the argument that NBC and the media have a responsibility to Nodar&rsquo;s family, and should show sensitivity and restrain during a time like this. That&rsquo;s only partially correct. They <em>must</em> be sensitive to the family&rsquo;s needs. However their responsibility is first and foremost to report the news, particularly significant stories such as this. Would we as a country ever tolerate the censorship of the 9/11 footage? If not that, why this?</p>

<p>To me, the footage represents a tribute to an athlete who died doing what he loved. If we are to learn from Nodar&rsquo;s death, it must be viewed as an agent of positive change in both our sport and our approach to track design and construction. I hope I never see the footage again. However showing it was a necessary decision and I agree with it completely.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Yahoo! Sports has an article about this topic, which I&rsquo;ve linked to at the bottom of the page. I want to highlight a brief passage from the article here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But before we vilify NBC, let&rsquo;s recognize that they were in a difficult spot. If they didn&rsquo;t show the video, people would be complaining that the network was protecting its asset (the Olympics) and not providing detailed coverage of an important story. That wouldn&rsquo;t be gratuitous, it would be bad journalism. By showing it the opposite argument is made. <mark>NBC was right to cover the story and showing the video was an acceptable news decision</mark>. However, showing it three times at the beginning of coverage and without an adequate warning was irresponsible.</p>
