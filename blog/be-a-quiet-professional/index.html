      <p>In a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/05/03/binladen.seals/index.html?hpt=Sbin">recent article on CNN</a>, former Navy SEAL Chris Heben discusses how SEALs live by an unspoken code - “<strong>Be a quiet professional</strong>”.</p>

<p>Like most young men, there was a time in my early twenties when I wondered if I had the will and determination to join the SEALs. I never actually considered enlisting, but for an entire summer I practiced 50m underwater swims (not recommended), earned a SCUBA license (amazing), practiced 100 consecutive pushups (easy), and flirted with long-distance running (impossible).  I retreated back to the safety of sport, 30m runs, warm water, and waking up at 11am.</p>

<p>Thankfully I didn’t forget everything that summer. I also read every book about SEALs I could find, including my personal favorite <a href="http://amzn.com/1400046955">The Warrior Elite, the forging of SEAL Class 228</a> by Dick Couch. A few important things have stuck with me from that book.</p>

<p>To be part of the SEALs is to be part of a warrior culture. A small part of that code is approaching your work as a quiet professional. That simple philosophy is worth its weight in gold when it comes to sport.</p>

<p>In 9 years of sliding I’ve witnessed and (sadly) participated in my fair share of complaining, bragging, whining, bitching, moaning, and two-faced mumbling. Fortunately I’ve also had the privilege of working closely with quiet professionals. I don’t need to name them. They know who they are, and so do you.</p>

<p>These athletes have taught me the value in rising above the level of petty gossip while embodying our own Olympic code. Most of them have gone on to achieve their Olympic dream, as well as success after sport. Season after season they focused on the things that matter, like physical and mental toughness, positive attitude, and skill work. They rose above the bullshit and completed their mission. That’s not easy, but as the SEAL instructors tell their trainees, suffer in silence.</p>

<p>I’m embracing this philosophy and making it a part of my training. Reading about SEAL culture makes me realize how simple that should be by comparison. In every community, sport-related or not, there will be people who sling mud, but the true professionals will keep quiet and complete the mission.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> I’d like to settle an old score with a few friends (I’m looking at you, Sand, Burgess, and Antoine). in 2005 While living in Chula Vista, CA at the Olympic Training Center, we had a debate about maximizing the distance of an underwater swim. I had read in Dick’s book that deeper is better, but I couldn’t remember the details. For your reading enjoyment:</p>

<blockquote>The secret to underwater swimming is going deep early. The trainees learn that if they swim along the bottom in deeper water, the increased partial pressure of oxygen in their lungs will allow them to hold their breath longer and swim farther.</blockquote>
