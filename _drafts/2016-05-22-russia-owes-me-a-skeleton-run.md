If the doping allegations against Russia prove true, they owe me an Olympic skeleton run. I consider myself lucky. They owe my teammates much more.

On February 15th, 2014, I was standing on the start line at the Sanki Sliding Centre preparing for my third competitive skeleton run. Though I didn’t know it at the time, it would be my last run of those Olympics.

An average skeleton run on the 1365 meter Sochi track takes about 57 seconds to complete. After three heats, the top-20 athletes advance to a fourth and final run. I was ranked 21st. In the subsequent medal-deciding run, I watched from the sidelines as my teammate Matt Antoine won a bronze medal behind Alexander Tretiakov of Russia and Martins Dukurs of Latvia. Tretiakov was one of several Russian medalists recently implicated in the massive state-sponsored doping scandal.

These revelations aren’t surprising. Like many of my teammates, I suspected as much for years. What surprised me was how reading their names in print did not bring the satisfaction and closure I hoped it would. Those feelings were replaced by a sense of betrayal by the organizations tasked with ensuring clean competition at the Olympic Games. The World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Olympic Committee must come down hard on Russia, but such an outcome is unlikely despite repeat abuses and mounting evidence of cheating. When it comes to getting off on doping charges, experience has taught me that the best defense an athlete can have is to compete for Russia.

The time has come for a reevaluation of Olympic drug testing procedures. The current system is broken. Assurances that my test sample is anonymous, that the collection vessel is tamper-proof, and that the testing lab is secure now amount to little more than empty promises. The mission statements of most doping agencies include a sentence or two about preserving the integrity of competition and protecting the rights of athletes. That's a clever romanticizing of their actual mission, which is to catch cheaters. However you look at it, they are failing.  

Russia’s cheating wasn’t just of the chemical kind. They cheated my teammate out of the medal he deserved, and many of us out of moments that can never be retroactively awarded. Though they only took from me 57 seconds, those were 57 seconds I earned through years of perseverance and dedication to my sport. They were 57 additional seconds my parents could have had watching their son realize his dream. They should be among the proudest moments of my life, but they will never be realized. It is just another debt that Russia can never repay.
