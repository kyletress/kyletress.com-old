<h1>The Setup</h1>

</header>

<p>I&rsquo;m Kyle Tress, an Olympic athlete, writer, and software developer. I race headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour. </p>

<h2>What hardware are you using?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m an Apple guy. I write and code on an 11&quot; MacBook Air, which is the best computer I&rsquo;ve ever owned. </p>

<p>My iPad Air 2 is my primary device. I use it for everything, including design and development. Sometimes I pair it with a Wireless Apple Keyboard and a 12South compass stand.</p>

<p>My iPhone 6 is an extension of my brain and I never leave home without it. I use it to capture ideas, browse the web, shoot 1 second videos, and update social media. It&rsquo;s my primary camera because I always have it with me. I&rsquo;m also really impressed with Apple Pay and I&rsquo;m eagerly awaiting the day when it can completely replace my wallet.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m an avid reader. I cut cable to make more time for the unread books on my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/kindle">Kindle Voyage</a>, but I still enjoy Netflix and Hulu Plus on my AppleTV. I have a Wii U for the occasional Zelda/Mario Kart fix.      </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m on the road 6 months per year. I love airplanes almost as much as I love Apple, but I couldn&rsquo;t survive a long flight without my Bose QuietComfort headphones. While traveling, essentials get packed away in my Scottevest Revolution, and the rest goes in my Tom Bihn aeronaut and copilot. I throw in a portable coffee kit consisting of an AeroPress, Hario Grinder, and an electric travel kettle and I&rsquo;m all set to make excellent coffee wherever my sled takes me. </p>

<h2>And what software?</h2>

<p>I write long form content in Scrivner. I used MarsEdit to manage my personal website until I switched from Wordpress to Siteleaf. Now I write Markdown in IA Writer on the Mac and Editorial on my iPad. </p>

<p>Atom is my code editor of choice, but these days I mostly connect to a Nitrous.io box. It gives me the freedom to code from anywhere I can get a cell signal. I use iTerm2 when doing command line work.  </p>

<p>I prefer Safari for daily browsing, but keep Chrome around for the occasional flash video (why won&rsquo;t you <em>die</em> already?). I couldn&rsquo;t imagine life without 1password, and integration with iOS 8 extensions has made it much more convenient.  </p>

<p>I use too many iOS apps to mention, but  a few of my favorites are: Mailbox, Flipboard, Netflix, NFL GamePass, Editorial, Diet Coda, Day One, Sky Guide, Prompt, and GoodReader. </p>

<p>Finally, I back everything up to the cloud. My code lives on GitHub, and of course I use iCloud. The fewer items on my local computer, the better.   </p>

<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy with my current setup, but I&rsquo;m interested in the rumors surrounding the 12&quot; MacBook Pro. I&rsquo;m also intrigued by the Apple Watch not just as a user, but a developer as well.</p>
