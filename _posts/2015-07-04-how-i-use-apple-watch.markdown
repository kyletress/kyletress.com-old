title: How I use Apple Watch

I bought an Apple Watch on launch day, and since then I've gotten a lot of questions about it. Besides the battery life (which is way better than expected), the most common question is "what does it do?". People want to know how the Apple Watch would fit into their lives. Inspired by [this post by Dmitir Bilgier](https://medium.com/@dmitribilgere/things-i-have-done-with-my-apple-watch-d7d31b289972), I wanted to write about the main ways I've used my Apple Watch so far.

**Mobile boarding pass** -- On a recent trip to Colorado, I used it to go through security and to check-in at the gate. Only once did I have problems scanning the QR code. It wouldn't scan at the gate in Chicago and I had to dig for my phone, holding up the line. Sorry folks. That aside, it made the airport experience more pleasant.

**Timing flights** --
The crew says the flight is going to be 2 hours and 30 minutes. Sounds great. What time did we leave again? How much longer do we have? What time zone am I going to? I timed all my flights takeoff to touchdown so I knew exactly how much flight time was remaining.

**Hey, Siri** -- I was a pretty regular Siri user before the Watch.  Now I can't imagine living without it. I'm constantly asking Siri for directions, phone numbers, upcoming appointments, and reminders. Simply raising your wrist and saying "Hey Siri" activates it, which is great if you're driving and need directions. I've also noticed a new feature: The "new" Siri is kind of a smart ass.

**Apple Pay** -- Using Apple Pay on the iPhone is fun. Using it on the watch is extraordinary. I still get excited to pay with Apple Watch, if only to see the cashier's reaction. I've had several tell me I'm the first to do so at their store. It feels like living in the future.  

**Daily reminder alarms** -- I'm a notoriously bad eater. I have no problem eating once per day, performance effects be damned. Paired with medication that further reduces my appetite, I have to be diligent about my eating habits. I set seven daily alarms on repeat Monday - Friday to remind me to eat. Overkill? Yeah probably, but it works.  

**Updating USADA** -- I wrote about my need to [update USADA](/essays/usada-workflow) on a regular basis. I automated the process with Workflow. No need to get my location or write an email. One tap and I'm done, right from the watch.  

**Notify me to film my 1SE** -- I've been filming one second every day since 2013. Some days I forget. I allow 1SE to notify me once per day, and I immediately shoot whatever is happening at that moment.

**Control my Apple TV** -- Using the watch as a remote is actually  easier than using the *real* Apple TV remote. I hate that thing.

**Weather station** -- Dark Sky notifies me up to an hour before light or heavy rain. I often ride my bike to training, so this is really helpful.

**Music** -- The watch has a few gigs set aside for music storage. Since the release of Apple Music, I've started to take advantage of this by syncing playlists directly to it and pairing it with my Beats headphones. It's nice to warmup and workout without risking my iPhone hitting the ground.  

**Track and time my workout** -- One of the main reasons I bought the watch was to time my workouts (rest between sets, tempo runs, etc). Any watch could fill this role, but I like having a dedicated heart rate monitor, step counter, calorie counter, etc. The watch will almost certainly gain additional sensors over time, making it more useful in this capacity. One nitpick -- there is no option for setting seconds in the timer. To get a 30-second timer, you have to ask Siri.

**Quickly respond to messages** -- It's amazing how often I can respond to a message right from the watch. It's smart, and will vary the suggested responses based on the message received. And if that doesn't work there's always dictation or an emoji :) .

**Silent notifications** -- Probably my favorite, and the most unsung, feature of the Apple Watch is a return to blissful silence. No more chimes, beeps, or ringtones. I feel a gentle tap on my wrist when a notification arrives, and I carefully control which get through. Before the watch I'd hear three notifications for the same incoming message: one from my iPhone, one from my iPad, and another from my Mac. That drove me crazy, especially when silencing them wasn't an option. Now everything is on silent all the time, and I don't have to worry about missing truly important notifications.

Granted, my iPhone could do nearly everything above, but the benefit of the Apple Watch is *how* it accomplishes these tasks. I couldn't cover everything for the sake of brevity. Suffice it to say I'm finding new uses every day. It's made a positive impact on my life, and I'm excited to see what developers do with native apps and watchOS 2. Wearables are here, and Apple is leading the way.
