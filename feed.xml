      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have become fully aware of the extent to which anger has a life of its own within me. It can lie dormant, like a virus, only to revive and make me miserable when I least expect it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to engage in activities, such as competitive rowing, that give me butterflies simply so I can practice dealing with them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Socrates was, Epictetus reminds us, &amp;ldquo;tolerant of being overlooked&amp;rdquo;, and those practicing Stoicism should likewise be tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In particular, says Seneca, we need to remember that in some case, the person at whom we are angry in fact helped us; in such cases, what angers us is that he didn&amp;rsquo;t help us more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a terrific introduction to modern Stoic thought. When we hear the word &lt;em&gt;stoic&lt;/em&gt;, we often think of a person who is devoid of emotion. But as Irvine explains, our modern interpretation of the stoic is not inline with the classical definition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How should I prepare for Skeleton School?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no preparation necessary for Skeleton School. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn how to drive beforehand &amp;ndash; you &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;. You can only learn that aspect of the sport through experience, which comes with taking runs down the track. Skeleton School is mostly an opportunity to see if you really enjoy the sport. It looks fun on TV, but there have been many people who thought the same thing only to arrive in Lake Placid, take a run, and leave that same day never to return. Just show up, listen to the coaches, and see if you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hated the fact that I had traveled all the way to Taiwan and had not even given myself a chance to compete. Some serious adjustments were called for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The real power of incremental growth comes to bear when we truly are like water, steadily carving stone. We just keep on flowing when everything is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IN competition, the dynamic is often painfully transparent. If one player is serenely present while the other is being ripped apart by internal issues, the outcome is already clear. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For much of this book I have described my vision of the road to mastery &amp;mdash; you start with the fundamentals, get a solid foundation fueled by understanding the principles of your discipline, then you expand and refine your repetoire, guided by your individual predispositions, while keeping in touch, however abstractly, with what you feel to be the essential core of the art. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The fact is that when there is intense comptiton, those who succeed have slightly more honed skills than the rest. It is rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Murray, on his penchant for showing up unannounced at odd places: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the only reason I&amp;rsquo;ve had the career life that I&amp;rsquo;ve had is that someone told me some secrets early on about living. You can do the very best you can when you&amp;rsquo;re very, very relaxed, no matter what it is or what your job is, the more relaxed you are the better you are. That&amp;rsquo;s sort of why I got into acting. I realized the more fun I had, the better I did it. And I thought, that&amp;rsquo;s a job I could be proud of. It&amp;rsquo;s changed my life learning that, and it&amp;rsquo;s made me better at what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
