      <title>The Wright Brothers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think David McCullough is one of the finest popular history writers of our time. With &lt;em&gt;The Wright Brothers&lt;/em&gt; he has delivered a rich account of the birth of powered flight. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about airplanes &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a biography of the two bicycle mechanics who willed them into existence through sheer intellect and unwavering commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCullough drew from the Wright&amp;rsquo;s meticulous diaries and personal correspondence. The result is an intimate look into the lives of Wilbur and Orville as they work in secret on solving the problem of powered flight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some takeaways from this book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This era was ripe with innovation. From photography to the automobile to the airplane, enterprising people were envisioning the future and &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; building it, despite ridicule and mockery. Comparisons can be made to our present era of innovation.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wright Brothers have a lot to teach us about courage, intellect, and dedication. They were risking their lives to solve the problem of powered flight, and they weren&amp;rsquo;t doing it for money or fame. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have a college education. They weren&amp;rsquo;t scientists or engineers. They were bicycle mechanics from Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time McCullough wrote about Wilbur or Orville taking to the sky&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d white-knuckle my chair. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget how dangerous the entire undertaking was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rarely flew together. In the event of a fatal crash, one would live to carry on their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a terrific introduction to modern Stoic thought. When we hear the word &lt;em&gt;stoic&lt;/em&gt;, we often think of a person who is devoid of emotion. But as Irvine explains, our modern interpretation of the stoic is not inline with the classical definition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How should I prepare for Skeleton School?</title>
      <link>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/how-should-i-prepare-for-skeleton-school</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Sep 2014 20:18:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <guid>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/how-should-i-prepare-for-skeleton-school</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no preparation necessary for Skeleton School. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn how to drive beforehand &amp;ndash; you &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;. You can only learn that aspect of the sport through experience, which comes with taking runs down the track. Skeleton School is mostly an opportunity to see if you really enjoy the sport. It looks fun on TV, but there have been many people who thought the same thing only to arrive in Lake Placid, take a run, and leave that same day never to return. Just show up, listen to the coaches, and see if you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/how-much-longer-will-you-compete</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best answer I can give is &lt;em&gt;at least through 2018&lt;/em&gt;. Skeleton athletes can be competitive into their 40s. I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying I will be, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When should I buy my first sled?</title>
      <link>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/when-should-i-buy-my-first-sled</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 17:10:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <guid>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/when-should-i-buy-my-first-sled</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I advise people to wait at least &lt;em&gt;one full season&lt;/em&gt; before purchasing equipment. Most people ignore this advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I recommend you wait is because you won&amp;rsquo;t have any clue what you&amp;rsquo;re doing your first year. You&amp;rsquo;ll probably have 2-3 months of time on the track, and you might take 10-15 runs per week. This time should be dedicated to building awareness, perfecting your form, getting a feel for the track, and soaking up as much knowledge as you can from the coaches. Messing around with equipment to try and go faster isn&amp;rsquo;t a priority yet. Plus, any sled you buy will likely be too sensitive for your abilities. The same goes with runners.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What kind of training should I be doing?</title>
      <link>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/what-kind-of-training-should-i-be-doing</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2014 17:02:00 -0400</pubDate>

      <guid>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/what-kind-of-training-should-i-be-doing</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recommend you find a good sprint coach, as speed development is probably the most important training for skeleton. If you&amp;rsquo;re in high school, join the track team. Otherwise, ask around at local colleges and find a coach you can train with once or twice per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strength is important too. You will need to focus on major lifts like squats and presses. Familiarizing yourself with the Olympic lifts (like the power clean) and get help if necessary. Proper form is important. &lt;/p&gt;
