      <title>How I use Apple Watch</title>

      <guid>http://kyletress.com/essays/how-i-use-apple-watch</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought an Apple Watch on launch day, and since then I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot of questions about it. Besides the battery life (which is way better than expected), the most common question is &amp;ldquo;what does it do?&amp;rdquo;. People want to know how the Apple Watch would fit into their lives. Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dmitribilgere/things-i-have-done-with-my-apple-watch-d7d31b289972&quot;&gt;this post by Dmitir Bilgier&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to write about the main ways I&amp;rsquo;ve used my Apple Watch so far. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile boarding pass&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; On a recent trip to Colorado, I used it to go through security and to check-in at the gate. Only once did I have problems scanning the QR code. It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t scan at the gate in Chicago and I had to dig for my phone, holding up the line. Sorry folks. That aside, it made the airport experience more pleasant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing flights&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; 
The crew says the flight is going to be 2 hours and 30 minutes. Sounds great. What time did we leave again? How much longer do we have? What time zone am I going to? I timed all my flights takeoff to touchdown so I knew exactly how much flight time was remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey, Siri&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; I was a pretty regular Siri user before the Watch.  Now I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine living without it. I&amp;rsquo;m constantly asking Siri for directions, phone numbers, upcoming appointments, and reminders. Simply raising your wrist and saying &amp;ldquo;Hey Siri&amp;rdquo; activates it, which is great if you&amp;rsquo;re driving and need directions. I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed a new feature: The &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; Siri is kind of a smart ass. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Using Apple Pay on the iPhone is fun. Using it on the watch is extraordinary. I still get excited to pay with Apple Watch, if only to see the cashier&amp;rsquo;s reaction. I&amp;rsquo;ve had several tell me I&amp;rsquo;m the first to do so at their store. It feels like living in the future.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily reminder alarms&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m a notoriously bad eater. I have no problem eating once per day, performance effects be damned. Paired with medication that further reduces my appetite, I have to be diligent about my eating habits. I set seven daily alarms on repeat Monday - Friday to remind me to eat. Overkill? Yeah probably, but it works.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating USADA&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; I wrote about my need to &lt;a href=&quot;/essays/usada-workflow&quot;&gt;update USADA&lt;/a&gt; on a regular basis. I automated the process with Workflow. No need to get my location or write an email. One tap and I&amp;rsquo;m done, right from the watch.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notify me to film my 1SE&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;ve been filming one second every day since 2013. Some days I forget. I allow 1SE to notify me once per day, and I immediately shoot whatever is happening at that moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control my Apple TV&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Using the watch as a remote is actually  easier than using the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; Apple TV remote. I hate that thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather station&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Dark Sky notifies me up to an hour before light or heavy rain. I often ride my bike to training, so this is really helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; The watch has a few gigs set aside for music storage. Since the release of Apple Music, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to take advantage of this by syncing playlists directly to it and pairing it with my Beats headphones. It&amp;rsquo;s nice to warmup and workout without risking my iPhone hitting the ground.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track and time my workout&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; One of the main reasons I bought the watch was to time my workouts (rest between sets, tempo runs, etc). Any watch could fill this role, but I like having a dedicated heart rate monitor, step counter, calorie counter, etc. The watch will almost certainly gain additional sensors over time, making it more useful in this capacity. One nitpick &amp;ndash; there is no option for setting seconds in the timer. To get a 30-second timer, you have to ask Siri.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickly respond to messages&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; It&amp;rsquo;s amazing how often I can respond to a message right from the watch. It&amp;rsquo;s smart, and will vary the suggested responses based on the message received. And if that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work there&amp;rsquo;s always dictation or an emoji :) .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silent notifications&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Probably my favorite, and the most unsung, feature of the Apple Watch is a return to blissful silence. No more chimes, beeps, or ringtones. I feel a gentle tap on my wrist when a notification arrives, and I carefully control which get through. Before the watch I&amp;rsquo;d hear three notifications for the same incoming message: one from my iPhone, one from my iPad, and another from my Mac. That drove me crazy, especially when silencing them wasn&amp;rsquo;t an option. Now everything is on silent all the time, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about missing truly important notifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, my iPhone could do nearly everything above, but the benefit of the Apple Watch is &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it accomplishes these tasks. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything for the sake of brevity. Suffice it to say I&amp;rsquo;m finding new uses every day. It&amp;rsquo;s made a positive impact on my life, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see what developers do with native apps and watchOS 2. Wearables are here, and Apple is leading the way. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A workflow for updating USADA</title>
      <link>http://kyletress.com/essays/usada-workflow</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 16:13:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <author>Kyle Tress</author>
      <guid>http://kyletress.com/essays/usada-workflow</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an Olympian, I&amp;rsquo;m subject to frequent random drug testing by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usada.org&quot;&gt;United States Anti-Doping Administration&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m in the &lt;em&gt;International Testing Pool&lt;/em&gt;, which means I&amp;rsquo;m required to provide USADA with a daily 60-minute time slot. Though technically I can be tested at any time, I &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be at my designated location during this 60-minute window or I&amp;rsquo;ll receive a missed test. Three missed tests in a 12-month period could result in a ban, so it&amp;rsquo;s important that I&amp;rsquo;m diligent with my updates. The problem is I&amp;rsquo;m not always diligent, and I imagine other athletes aren&amp;rsquo;t either. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of ways to update USADA, but by far the easiest is to send an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:update@usada.org&quot;&gt;update@usada.org&lt;/a&gt;. Most of my teammates set a blanket 60-minute time slot for the entire quarter, then update via email as their plans change. This is simple and easy, but not without its inconveniences. First, it&amp;rsquo;s annoying to have to write the same email every time. Second, I might not have the address at my location. As a developer, I saw an opportunity to remove some of the headache and repetition for myself and other athletes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;USADA has a mobile app, but it frequently crashes and it&amp;rsquo;s hard to use&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Their website isn&amp;rsquo;t much better. There&amp;rsquo;s no public API, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t create my own app. I wanted the simplicity of email updates with the convenience of a &amp;lsquo;native&amp;rsquo; mobile app. Enter &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Workflow App&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workflow is an app that bills itself as &amp;lsquo;powerful automation made simple&amp;rsquo;. Federico Viticci of MacStories.net wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macstories.net/reviews/workflow-review-integrated-automation-for-ios-8/&quot;&gt;a terrific review of Workflow&lt;/a&gt;, so I won&amp;rsquo;t retread that ground here. Suffice it to say, Workflow makes it possible to automate repetitive tasks by taking advantage of native iOS functionality. A workflow can be saved on the home screen of your device and act as its own little native app. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Update USADA Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my requirements, setting up the workflow was easy. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the current location and save it as a variable &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the user for a 60-minute time slot, and save it as &lt;code&gt;timeslot&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:update@usada.org&quot;&gt;update@usada.org&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;location&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;timeslot&lt;/code&gt; pre-populated in the body. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/workflow-1.png&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Creating the workflow&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/workflow-2.png&quot;&gt; 
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Entering a 60-minute window&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/workflow-3.png&quot;&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;The compose sheet if more info is necessary&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/workflow-7.png&quot;&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Putting the &amp;lsquo;app&amp;rsquo; on the home screen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to use it.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one tap from my iPhone or iPad, I can now instantly update USADA with my current whereabouts and a new 60-minute time slot, all without writing an email or opening Maps. I tap on the icon, add my 60 minute window from the picker, and the rest happens automatically. If I need to add additional details to the email, I can adjust the workflow to show the &amp;lsquo;Compose Sheet&amp;rsquo;, but I normally just let Workflow send the email instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Updating is even easier on the Apple Watch. I open Workflow, press the &amp;lsquo;Update USADA&amp;rsquo; button, and I&amp;rsquo;m done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/worklow-4.jpg&quot;&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Launching from Apple Watch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;shot&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/workflow-5.jpg&quot;&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Getting the location&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;shot&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/workflow-6.jpg&quot;&gt; 
&lt;figcaption&gt;Sending the email&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a USADA athlete with an iOS device? &lt;a href=&quot;https://workflow.is/workflows/a63ae7a9649f48dda111b2c4d917198c&quot;&gt;Download my &lt;em&gt;Update USADA&lt;/em&gt; workflow&lt;/a&gt;. You&amp;rsquo;ll need the Workflow app to use it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My biggest criticism of the app is that it was clearly built with a cross-platform solution such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://xamarin.com&quot;&gt;Xamarin&lt;/a&gt; to make it available for Android and iOS. The proposed benefit is a single codebase that works on both platforms, but the result is often a mess that isn&amp;rsquo;t optimized for either. The resulting crashes and conflicts with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/&quot;&gt;iOS Human Interface Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate the latter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>The Wright Brothers</title>
      <link>http://kyletress.com/reading/the-wright-brothers</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 21 May 2015 22:10:00 -0400</pubDate>
      <author>Kyle Tress</author>
      <guid>http://kyletress.com/reading/the-wright-brothers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think David McCullough is one of the finest popular history writers of our time. With &lt;em&gt;The Wright Brothers&lt;/em&gt; he has delivered a rich account of the birth of powered flight. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t a book about airplanes &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s a biography of the two bicycle mechanics who willed them into existence through sheer intellect and unwavering commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McCullough drew from the Wright&amp;rsquo;s meticulous diaries and personal correspondence. The result is an intimate look into the lives of Wilbur and Orville as they work in secret on solving the problem of powered flight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some takeaways from this book&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This era was ripe with innovation. From photography to the automobile to the airplane, enterprising people were envisioning the future and &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; building it, despite ridicule and mockery. Comparisons can be made to our present era of innovation.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wright Brothers have a lot to teach us about courage, intellect, and dedication. They were risking their lives to solve the problem of powered flight, and they weren&amp;rsquo;t doing it for money or fame. They didn&amp;rsquo;t have a college education. They weren&amp;rsquo;t scientists or engineers. They were bicycle mechanics from Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time McCullough wrote about Wilbur or Orville taking to the sky&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;d white-knuckle my chair. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget how dangerous the entire undertaking was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They rarely flew together. In the event of a fatal crash, one would live to carry on their work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a terrific introduction to modern Stoic thought. When we hear the word &lt;em&gt;stoic&lt;/em&gt;, we often think of a person who is devoid of emotion. But as Irvine explains, our modern interpretation of the stoic is not inline with the classical definition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How should I prepare for Skeleton School?</title>
      <link>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/how-should-i-prepare-for-skeleton-school</link>

      <guid>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/how-should-i-prepare-for-skeleton-school</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no preparation necessary for Skeleton School. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn how to drive beforehand &amp;ndash; you &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;. You can only learn that aspect of the sport through experience, which comes with taking runs down the track. Skeleton School is mostly an opportunity to see if you really enjoy the sport. It looks fun on TV, but there have been many people who thought the same thing only to arrive in Lake Placid, take a run, and leave that same day never to return. Just show up, listen to the coaches, and see if you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The best answer I can give is &lt;em&gt;at least through 2018&lt;/em&gt;. Skeleton athletes can be competitive into their 40s. I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; saying I will be, but it&amp;rsquo;s possible. &lt;/p&gt;
