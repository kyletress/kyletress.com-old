      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve couldn&amp;rsquo;t distinguish between the extraneous in the critical. As CEO of a fledgling company, that was his key responsibility. At NeXT, he utterly failed to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working on any project, work with the best people in the business, the best people in the world — expertise in every field of endeavors, the best chemistry, the best unity— and work in secrecy. And when it’s least expected, hit everybody between the eyes with the phenomenal, the most powerful, unexpected project. Then it becomes historical because you have a perfect gem. But strive for excellence and perfection in everything. Study the greats and become greater— in secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have become fully aware of the extent to which anger has a life of its own within me. It can lie dormant, like a virus, only to revive and make me miserable when I least expect it. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Socrates was, Epictetus reminds us, &amp;ldquo;tolerant of being overlooked&amp;rdquo;, and those practicing Stoicism should likewise be tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In particular, says Seneca, we need to remember that in some case, the person at whom we are angry in fact helped us; in such cases, what angers us is that he didn&amp;rsquo;t help us more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a terrific introduction to modern Stoic thought. When we hear the word &lt;em&gt;stoic&lt;/em&gt;, we often think of a person who is devoid of emotion. But as Irvine explains, our modern interpretation of the stoic is not inline with the classical definition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How should I prepare for Skeleton School?</title>
      <link>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/how-should-i-prepare-for-skeleton-school</link>

      <guid>http://kyletress.com/skeleton/faqs/how-should-i-prepare-for-skeleton-school</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no preparation necessary for Skeleton School. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn how to drive beforehand &amp;ndash; you &lt;em&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt;. You can only learn that aspect of the sport through experience, which comes with taking runs down the track. Skeleton School is mostly an opportunity to see if you really enjoy the sport. It looks fun on TV, but there have been many people who thought the same thing only to arrive in Lake Placid, take a run, and leave that same day never to return. Just show up, listen to the coaches, and see if you like it.&lt;/p&gt;
