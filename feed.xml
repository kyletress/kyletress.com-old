      <description>&lt;p&gt;Steve couldn&amp;rsquo;t distinguish between the extraneous in the critical. As CEO of a fledgling company, that was his key responsibility. At NeXT, he utterly failed to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Presidential Reading List</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been fascinated by the Presidency of the United States for many years. I can probably trace it back to my childhood, as I grew up in an area that&amp;rsquo;s rich in American history. Just a mile or so from my house, On Christmas Eve 1775, George Washington crossed the Delaware River and engaged the Hessian soldiers in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton&quot;&gt;Battle of Trenton&lt;/a&gt;. The battle was a turning point for the war &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the man. Morale had been low and the weather severe. The Continental Army had suffered many defeats at the hands of the British and the revolution was starting to crumble. But Washington was stoic. He devised a brash plan and under the cover of darkness, crossed the icy Delaware for a suprise attack. That small victory singlehandedly turned the tide of the Revolution, and the myth of George Washington began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we are intimately familiar with his myth, from the cherry tree to his wooden teeth. But what about the &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; man behind the anecdotes? Who was he? How did he become the Father of our Nation? The challenge faced by any biographer of Washington is wading through the mythology to find the truth lurking beneath.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington doesn&amp;rsquo;t stand alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trenton is fascinating, but it has nothing on Philadelphia. The original Capitol of the United States is brimming with presidential history, and is the place where the idea of the Presidency came to fruition. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/washington-crossing.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Crossing the Delaware&lt;/em&gt;, 1851.  Emanuel Gottlieb Leutze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These places are fascinating in their own right, but what about the men themselves? I knew very little about most, and almost nothing about others. This is pretty common. What can you tell me about John Tyler&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; rel=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;? Benjamin Harrison? Outside of a useless 5th grade assignment where I had to memorize their order (but nothing about them), I didn&amp;rsquo;t start to learn about their lives until later in life. Even so, my research has been haphazard. So I&amp;rsquo;m starting a new reading project. I&amp;rsquo;ll be reading biographies of the U.S. Presidents, in order, starting with &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Washington: A Life&lt;/a&gt; by Ron Chernow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t intend for this to be a sprint but a lifelong project. I want to think deeply about the people who have guided our country through difficult times, and the circumstances which put them in that position. I hope to learn something about the nature of power, politics, and history &amp;ndash; and when I do, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it here. I do solemnly swear. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li id=&quot;fn1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fact about John Tyler that will blow your mind. He was born in 1790, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/01/president-tyler-grandson-alive.html&quot;&gt;he has two living grandchildren&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref1&quot; rev=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When working on any project, work with the best people in the business, the best people in the world — expertise in every field of endeavors, the best chemistry, the best unity— and work in secrecy. And when it’s least expected, hit everybody between the eyes with the phenomenal, the most powerful, unexpected project. Then it becomes historical because you have a perfect gem. But strive for excellence and perfection in everything. Study the greats and become greater— in secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;Run 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/e_qCjYmq-gQ?start=1126&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting the World Cup season this late in December is a bit unusual, but I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for the delay. It gave me a chance get some experience on my new sled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always added pressure for home World Cup races, but our team did very well. All 5 American athletes finished in the top 10. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with my result despite a few mistakes at the top of the track on both runs. In the video above you can see my sled drift to the left between curves 1-2 around the 19:16 mark, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t an ideal setup for curve 3. I was able to correct this quickly without too much trouble, and the rest of the run was good. 4th place at the bottom! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Run 2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;394&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/CA_v7gnYT7Q?start=2520&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On run 2, I again had issues with curve 3, but it was on the exit. You can see (and hear) the sled skid around the 42:36 mark. Then things got a little wild out of curve 12 at 42:56. I was off the pace before that point, so I think the skid at the top killed my chances of a top 4 finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I&amp;rsquo;m pleased with the result, and now looking forward to a great week in Calgary for World Cup #2.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.siteleaf.com&quot;&gt;Siteleaf&lt;/a&gt; to power my personal website for several months. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing service, but I have one complaint &amp;ndash; they don&amp;rsquo;t have an iOS app. They &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-api&quot;&gt;terrific API&lt;/a&gt;, so I decided to learn iOS development by building an app to interact with it. Like many of my projects, this is an example of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;dogfooding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;; building something I need and want to use myself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/iPhone%206%20Black%204.7%20Inch%20Form%20Factor.png&quot; alt=&quot;iPhone 6 Black 4.7 Inch Form Factor&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app makes use of all the available API endpoints. Basic Authentication is needed to validate each request, and I store the user&amp;rsquo;s credentials in the Keychain.&lt;/p&gt;
