Skeleton is not a easy by any stretch of the imagination. It challenges you mentally and physically. It requires strength and power. It requires skill and experience. It's a technical sport. It's a feeling sport. It's all these things and more. Oh, and it's a damn *expensive* sport, too.

I think the myth that skeleton is easy comes from an article published by Rick Reilly a few years ago in Sports Illustrated. Rick took a cheap shot at us because he probably saw an easy target. We called him out on it, offered him a chance to come up to Lake Placid and try skeleton for free, courtesy of the United States skeleton team. Not the tourist version of skeleton - but the *real* sport, from the top of the track - 80 miles per hour, headfirst. Rick definitely got the invite, but we never heard from him.

Rick, the offer still stands. Bring extra pads.
