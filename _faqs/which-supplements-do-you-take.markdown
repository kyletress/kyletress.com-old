*Mandatory disclaimer*: Consult your doctor first and all that.

I like [MusclePharm products](http://www.musclepharm.com). I use Combat (protein), Assault (preworkout), and Recon (postworkout). I also take creatine monohydrate, caffeine, vitamin D, fish oil, ZMA (nightime recovery), and the occasional multivitamin.
