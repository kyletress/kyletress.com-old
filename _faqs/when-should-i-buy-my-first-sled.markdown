I advise people to wait at least *one full season* before purchasing equipment. Most people ignore this advice.

The reason I recommend you wait is because you won't have any clue what you're doing your first year. You'll probably have 2-3 months of time on the track, and you might take 10-15 runs per week. This time should be dedicated to building awareness, perfecting your form, getting a feel for the track, and soaking up as much knowledge as you can from the coaches. Messing around with equipment to try and go faster isn't a priority yet. Plus, any sled you buy will likely be too sensitive for your abilities. The same goes with runners.
