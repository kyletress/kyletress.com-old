I compete on a Willi Schneider sled with Schneider runners. This season I'll be transitioning to a Protostar sled. I have successfully competed on Hass, Davenport, Walser, and Protostar sleds at different points in my career, and found them all to be highly capable. The sled is *rarely* the limiting factor, and I'm skeptical when I hear new athletes complain about bent, slow, or uncompetitive sleds.

Of course I'm guilty of this myself. It's hard not to be in a timed sport. But I've learned more often than not, an expert driver can overcome almost any equipment "problem".
