Two memories will forever be burned in my brain: Walking into Opening Ceremonies with Matt Antoine and John Daly, and seeing my mom, dad, brother, and [girlfriend](http://www.morgantracey.us) waiting for me at the finish line after my final run. It was a very long road to get there, but those two memories made it all worthwhile.
