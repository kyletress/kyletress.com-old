In more ways than I could mention. Everything fell into place when I saw skeleton for the first time. Prior to that, I was directionless. I dropped in and out of school, played in a band, and considered pursuing a career as an actor. After seeing skeleton, I didn't need to read about it, or research it, I just knew it was *it*.

Skeleton pushed me in ways I never expected. It taught me to appreciate hard work, because that's the reward. It allowed me to travel the world. It introduced me to [my girlfriend](http://www.morgantracey.us) and two of my [best](http://www.mattantoine.com) [friends](http://www.twitter.com/johndalyusa). It gave me [one of the greatest moments in my life](/skeleton/sochi), and enough memories and friendships to last a lifetime.

I also hated to fly. Now, with 20+ flights per year, it's one of my favorite things to do.
