I recommend you find a good sprint coach, as speed development is probably the most important training for skeleton. If you're in high school, join the track team. Otherwise, ask around at local colleges and find a coach you can train with once or twice per week.

Strength is important too. You will need to focus on major lifts like squats and presses. Familiarizing yourself with the Olympic lifts (like the power clean) and get help if necessary. Proper form is important.
