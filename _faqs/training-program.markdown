Many people don't realize how much training bobsled and skeleton athletes do. My program last several hours every day, 6 days per week. I sprint, lift, recover, eat, and do sport-specific training regularly. Here's a typical summer day for me:

|Time|Activity
|----|--------
|8:30am|Wake up. Breakfast
|10:00|Sports Medicine. Warm Up. Snack
|10:30|Sprint workout
|12:00|Lunch
|2:30|Snack. Preworkout
|3:00|Lift.
|4:30|Postworkout snack. Recovery center
|7:00|Dinner
|9:00|Snack
|12|Bed

I'm on that schedule 3 or 4 days per week, with a lighter *tempo* day on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
