Injuries are a part of sport, but skeleton injuries tend to be less gruesome than people think. We get some cuts and bruises, ice burn, and occasional lower leg injuries from sprinting. Serious injuries are rare.

Rhe most dangerous injury would come from hitting something in the track. That's my biggest fear in the sport. If a skeleton athlete hit something head on at full speed, the outcome would probably be deadly.
