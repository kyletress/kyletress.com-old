<h2>Weekly sponsorships</h2>

<p>I offer one &ldquo;mini&rdquo; sponsorship each week to individuals, products, or companies. Sponsorships are available in-season and off-season. A sponsor receives:</p>

<ul>
<li>a thank you tweet at the end of the week.</li>
<li>a thank you post on my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kyletressskeleton">Facebook</a> page.</li>
<li>a brief post on my website at the beginning of the week. </li>
<li>a small banner at the top of my site for the entire week.</li>
<li>a thank you message in my weekly newsletter.<br></li>
</ul>

<p>In-season subscribers also receive:</p>

<ul>
<li>logo placement on equipment (races are televised).</li>
</ul>

<p>Mini-sponsorships are a great way to test the waters before jumping into a longer-term commitment. The International Olympic Committee recently eased the rules regarding athlete promotion of personal sponsors during the Olympics. As a additional benefit, <em>I will give weekly sponsors priority going into the 2018 Games</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Sponsorships are available for $250/week.</strong> You can book by emailing <a href="mailto:kyle@kyletress.com?subject=Sponsorship%20Inquiry">kyle@kyletress.com</a>.</p>
