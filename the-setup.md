title: The Setup
---

I'm Kyle Tress, an Olympic skeleton athlete and software developer. I race headfirst down a mountain of ice at 90 miles per hour.

## What hardware are you using?

I'm an Apple guy. My work machine is a base model 12" MacBook which I primarily use for writing, designing, and coding. Outside of work, the iPad Air 2 is my go-to device. The multitasking features of iOS 9 are amazing, so much so that I prefer iOS to OS X for general use.

My iPhone 6 is an extension of my brain, and I never leave home without it. I use it to capture ideas, browse the web, listen to podcasts, shoot 1 second videos, and update social media. It's my primary camera.

I bought an Apple Watch on launch day, and I love it. I keep all my devices on silent and trust the watch to relay important information. It's also a great training and travel partner. Using Apple Pay is frictionless, and I'm eagerly awaiting the day when it replaces my wallet.

I'm an avid reader. I cut cable to make more time for the unread books on my [Kindle Voyage](http://www.amazon.com/kindle), but I still enjoy Netflix and Hulu Plus on my AppleTV. I have a Wii U for the occasional Zelda/Mario Kart fix.      

I'm on the road 6 months per year. I love airplanes almost as much as I love Apple, but I couldn't survive a long flight without my Beats Solo headphones. While traveling, essentials get packed in my Scottevest Revolution jacket, and the rest goes in my Tom Bihn aeronaut and copilot. I throw in an AeroPress, Hario Grinder, and an electric travel kettle and I'm all set to make great coffee wherever my sled takes me.

## And what software?
I write long form content in Ulysses. Atom is my code editor of choice.

I prefer Safari for daily browsing. I couldn't imagine life without 1password, and integration with iOS 8 extensions has made it much more convenient.  

I use too many iOS apps to mention, but a few favorites include Netflix, NYTimes, Alien Blue, NFL GamePass, Diet Coda, Day One, Sky Guide, and GoodReader.

I try to live in the cloud as much as possible. My code is on GitHub, and I rely heavily on iCloud. The fewer items on my local computer, the better.   

## What would be your dream setup?
I'm really happy with my current setup. I'll probably get a retina iMac for my design/development work when I stop traveling so much. I would upgrade my office with a standing/sitting desk, ergonomic office chair, and if I was really fancy, an Eames Lounge for reading and relaxing.
