<h1>Meditations</h1>
  <p>A New Translation, with an Introduction, by Gregory Hays <span>by Marcus Aurelius,  Gregory Hays </span></p>
</header>


<section class="book-summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>My favorite book, and one of the greatest ever written. It&rsquo;s ironic since Marcus Aurelius never intended it for publication. The <em>Meditations</em>, or <em>Thoughts to Myself</em> as it might more accurately be translated, has survived the centuries for good reason. There is something comforting about reading the private thoughts of the most powerful man in the world at the time, as he faces similar problems to the kind we encounter today. A must read for practicing Stoics and those intersted in developing an operating system for life. </p>

  <p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can&rsquo;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.</p>
