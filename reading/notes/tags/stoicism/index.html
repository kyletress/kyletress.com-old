<p>I have become fully aware of the extent to which anger has a life of its own within me. It can lie dormant, like a virus, only to revive and make me miserable when I least expect it. </p>

<p>I like to engage in activities, such as competitive rowing, that give me butterflies simply so I can practice dealing with them.</p>

<p>In particular, says Seneca, we need to remember that in some case, the person at whom we are angry in fact helped us; in such cases, what angers us is that he didn&rsquo;t help us more.</p>

<p>Our actions may be impeded&hellip;but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.</p>

<p>Difficulty shows what men are. Therefore when a difficulty falls upon you, remember that God, like a trainer of wrestlers, has matched you with a rough young man. Why? So that you may become an Olympic conqueror; but it is not accomplished without sweat.</p>

<p>When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can&rsquo;t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.</p>
