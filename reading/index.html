        <article class="book">
          <h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1KwxjQO">Sapiens</a> by Yuval Noah Hasari</h4>
          <p>A whirlwind tour through the history of humanity focusing on our 3 major revolutions: cognitive, agricultural, and scientific. Sapiens will forever alter your opinion of what happens when humans arrive in an environment (we  basically destroy it), and it concludes with a speculative look into the future of our species.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1KGhnik">The Wright Brothers</a> by David McCullough</h4>
          <p>I think David McCullough is one of the finest popular history writers of our time. With <em>The Wright Brothers</em> he has delivered a rich account of the birth of powered flight. But this isn&rsquo;t a book about airplanes &ndash; it&rsquo;s a biography of the two bicycle mechanics who willed them into existence through sheer intellect and unwavering commitment.</p>

          <h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1EIXXB2">How Adam Smith Can Change Your Life</a> by Russ Roberts</h4>
          <p>With chapters on &lsquo;How to be Happy&rsquo;, &lsquo;How to be Good&rsquo;, and &lsquo;How to Make the World a Better Place&rsquo;, this is a quick and enjoyable introduction to Adam Smith&rsquo;s forgotten classic. Whether you decide to read The Theory of Moral Sentiments or not, definitely check this book out. </p>

          <h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1KGhRVC">Zero To One</a> by Peter Theil</h4>
          <p>As Theil says, &ldquo;the next Larry Page and Sergei Brin won&rsquo;t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won&rsquo;t create a social network&rdquo;. Most businesses take the world from 1 to N. this is a book about building something completely new and taking the world from 0 to 1.  </p>

        <article class="book">
          <h4><a href="http://amzn.to/1KvheLF">Resilience</a> by Eric Greitens</h4>
          <p>Greitens is a Navy SEAL, Rhode Scholar, author of the New York Times Bestseller <em>The Heart and the Fist</em>, and candidate for Governor of Missouri. Here he offers something reminiscent of Seneca. Resilience is presented as a series of letters between Greitens and a former SEAL teammate who is suffering from PTSD. Like Seneca, this is a book worth dipping into from time to time.</p>

          <h4><a href="">Michael Jackson, Inc</a> by Zach O'Malley Greenburg</h4>
          <p>One of the best business books I read in 2014. I came away with a new appreciation for Michael Jackson, particularly his business sense. Since his death in 2009, his estate has brought in hundreds of millions of dollars, largely in music licensing deals he negotiated throughout his career. </p>

        <article class="book">
          <h4><a href="">A Guide to the Good Life</a> by </h4>
          <p>This book is a terrific introduction to modern Stoic thought. When we hear the word <em>stoic</em>, we often think of a person who is devoid of emotion. But as Irvine explains, our modern interpretation of the stoic is not inline with the classical definition.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m loving this book by Nick Bostrom, Oxford professor and Director of the Future of Humanity Institute. Artificial Intelligence is one of my favorite subjects of study and one of the themes I build my  collection around. I consider it one of the most important topics of the 21st century, and too few are talking about it. Bostrom discusses many possible paths to the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence and Artificial Superintelligence. These issues are of extreme importance, because we will likely only get one chance to get it right. </p>

        <article class="book">
          <h4><a href="">Philosophy for life and other dangerous situations</a> by </h4>
          <p>I learned about Jules Evans through the work of Ryan Holiday. Evans has a terrific website where he teaches <em>street philosophy</em> to interested students. It&rsquo;s a practical approach to the field that aims to disrupt its stuffy, academic reputation. <em>Philosophy for Life</em> gives readers a comprehensive look at the most enduring ideas from philosophy, which despite being over two thousand years old, can help us navigate the modern world.</p>

        <article class="book">
          <h4><a href="">The Obstacle is the Way</a> by </h4>
          <p>I preordered <em>The Obstacle is the Way</em> shortly after Ryan announced the book. I&rsquo;m a fan of his <a href="">reading recommendations newsletter</a>, upon which <a href="/reading-recommendations">my own</a> is based. Stoicism is growing in popularity, and it&rsquo;s refreshing to see classics like <em>Meditations</em> and <em>Letters from a Stoic</em> once again get their time in the spotlight. Aurelius, Seneca, and the rest of the Stoics continue to inspire readers despite significant cultural, technological, and historical distance. In this book, Ryan illustrates Stoic principals through the use of historical anecdotes, from the Battle of Vicksburg to the rise of the Rockefellers. </p>

    <h3>April</h3>
      
        <article class="book">
          <h4><a href="">Meditations</a> by </h4>
          <p>My favorite book, and one of the greatest ever written. It&rsquo;s ironic since Marcus Aurelius never intended it for publication. The <em>Meditations</em>, or <em>Thoughts to Myself</em> as it might more accurately be translated, has survived the centuries for good reason. There is something comforting about reading the private thoughts of the most powerful man in the world at the time, as he faces similar problems to the kind we encounter today. A must read for practicing Stoics and those intersted in developing an operating system for life.</p>
