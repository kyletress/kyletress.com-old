        <dd><p>I&rsquo;m loving this book by Nick Bostrom, Oxford professor and Director of the Future of Humanity Institute. Artificial Intelligence is one of my favorite subjects of study and one of the themes I build my  collection around. I consider it one of the most important topics of the 21st century, and too few are talking about it. Bostrom discusses many possible paths to the emergence of Artificial General Intelligence and Artificial Superintelligence. These issues are of extreme importance, because we will likely only get one chance to get it right. </p>

        <dd><p>I learned about Jules Evans through the work of Ryan Holiday. Evans has a terrific website where he teaches <em>street philosophy</em> to interested students. It&rsquo;s a practical approach to the field that aims to disrupt its stuffy, academic reputation. <em>Philosophy for Life</em> gives readers a comprehensive look at the most enduring ideas from philosophy, which despite being over two thousand years old, can help us navigate the modern world.</p>

        <dt><a href="/reading/the-obstacle-is-the-way">The Obstacle is the Way</a></dt>
        <dd><p>I preordered <em>The Obstacle is the Way</em> shortly after Ryan announced the book. I&rsquo;m a fan of his <a href="">reading recommendations newsletter</a>, upon which <a href="/reading-recommendations">my own</a> is based. Stoicism is growing in popularity, and it&rsquo;s refreshing to see classics like <em>Meditations</em> and <em>Letters from a Stoic</em> once again get their time in the spotlight. Aurelius, Seneca, and the rest of the Stoics continue to inspire readers despite significant cultural, technological, and historical distance. In this book, Ryan illustrates Stoic principals through the use of historical anecdotes, from the Battle of Vicksburg to the rise of the Rockefellers. </p>

        <dd><p>My favorite book, and one of the greatest ever written. It&rsquo;s ironic since Marcus Aurelius never intended it for publication. The <em>Meditations</em>, or <em>Thoughts to Myself</em> as it might more accurately be translated, has survived the centuries for good reason. There is something comforting about reading the private thoughts of the most powerful man in the world at the time, as he faces similar problems to the kind we encounter today. A must read for practicing Stoics and those intersted in developing an operating system for life. </p>
