  <h1>The Wright Brothers</h1>
  <p class"meta"> <em>by</em> David McCullough </p>
</header>

<p>I think David McCullough is one of the finest popular history writers of our time. With <em>The Wright Brothers</em> he has delivered a rich account of the birth of powered flight. But this isn&rsquo;t a book about airplanes &ndash; it&rsquo;s a biography of the two bicycle mechanics who willed them into existence through sheer intellect and unwavering commitment.</p>

<p>McCullough drew from the Wright&rsquo;s meticulous diaries and personal correspondence. The result is an intimate look into the lives of Wilbur and Orville as they work in secret on solving the problem of powered flight. </p>

<p>Some takeaways from this book</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This era was ripe with innovation. From photography to the automobile to the airplane, enterprising people were envisioning the future and <em>actively</em> building it, despite ridicule and mockery. Comparisons can be made to our present era of innovation.      </p></li>
<li><p>The Wright Brothers have a lot to teach us about courage, intellect, and dedication. They were risking their lives to solve the problem of powered flight, and they weren&rsquo;t doing it for money or fame. They didn&rsquo;t have a college education. They weren&rsquo;t scientists or engineers. They were bicycle mechanics from Ohio. </p></li>
<li><p>Every time McCullough wrote about Wilbur or Orville taking to the sky<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I&rsquo;d white-knuckle my chair. It&rsquo;s easy to forget how dangerous the entire undertaking was. </p></li>
</ol>
