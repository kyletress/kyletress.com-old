  <p>The timeless art of turning trials into triumph <span>by Ryan Holiday </span></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I preordered <em>The Obstacle is the Way</em> shortly after Ryan announced the book. I&rsquo;m a fan of his <a href="">reading recommendations newsletter</a>, upon which <a href="/reading-recommendations">my own</a> is based. Stoicism is growing in popularity, and it&rsquo;s refreshing to see classics like <em>Meditations</em> and <em>Letters from a Stoic</em> once again get their time in the spotlight. Aurelius, Seneca, and the rest of the Stoics continue to inspire readers despite significant cultural, technological, and historical distance. In this book, Ryan illustrates Stoic principals through the use of historical anecdotes, from the Battle of Vicksburg to the rise of the Rockefellers. </p>

  <p>Could you be doing more? You probably could - there&rsquo;s always more. At minimum, you could be trying harder. You might have gotten started, but your full effort isn&rsquo;t in it - and that shows.</p>

  <p>Demosthenes found his true calling: He would be the voice of Athens, its great speaker and conscience. He would be successful precisely because of what he&rsquo;d been through and how he&rsquo;d reacted to it. He had channeled his rage and pain into his training, and then later into his speeches, fueling it all with a kind of fierceness and power that could be neither matched nor resisted.</p>

  <p>How about that business decision that turned out ot be a mistake? Well, you had a hypothesis and it turned out to be wrong. Why should that upset you? It wouldn&rsquo;t piss off a scientist, it would <em>help</em> him. Maybe don&rsquo;t bet so much on it next time. And now you&rsquo;ve learned two things: that your instinct was wrong, and the kind of appetite for risk you really have.</p>

  <p>Our actions may be impeded&hellip;but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.</p>
