      <h1>A workflow for updating USADA</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content-body">
      <p>As an Olympian, I&rsquo;m subject to frequent random drug testing by the <a href="http://www.usada.org">United States Anti-Doping Administration</a>. I&rsquo;m in the <em>International Testing Pool</em>, which means I&rsquo;m required to provide USADA with a daily 60-minute time slot. Though technically I can be tested at any time, I <em>must</em> be at my designated location during this 60-minute window or I&rsquo;ll receive a missed test. Three missed tests in a 12-month period could result in a ban, so it&rsquo;s important that I&rsquo;m diligent with my updates. The problem is I&rsquo;m not always diligent, and I imagine other athletes aren&rsquo;t either. </p>

<p>There are lots of ways to update USADA, but by far the easiest is to send an email to <a href="mailto:update@usada.org">update@usada.org</a>. Most of my teammates set a blanket 60-minute time slot for the entire quarter, then update via email as their plans change. This is simple and easy, but not without its inconveniences. First, it&rsquo;s annoying to have to write the same email every time. Second, I might not have the address at my location. As a developer, I saw an opportunity to remove some of the headache and repetition for myself and other athletes. </p>

<p>USADA has a mobile app, but it frequently crashes and it&rsquo;s hard to use<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Their website isn&rsquo;t much better. There&rsquo;s no public API, so I couldn&rsquo;t create my own app. I wanted the simplicity of email updates with the convenience of a &lsquo;native&rsquo; mobile app. Enter <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a>.   </p>

<h2>Workflow App</h2>

<p>Workflow is an app that bills itself as &lsquo;powerful automation made simple&rsquo;. Federico Viticci of MacStories.net wrote <a href="http://www.macstories.net/reviews/workflow-review-integrated-automation-for-ios-8/">a terrific review of Workflow</a>, so I won&rsquo;t retread that ground here. Suffice it to say, Workflow makes it possible to automate repetitive tasks by taking advantage of native iOS functionality. A workflow can be saved on the home screen of your device and act as its own little native app. </p>

<h2>The Update USADA Workflow</h2>

<p>Given my requirements, setting up the workflow was easy. Here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the current location and save it as a variable <code>location</code>.</li>
<li>Ask the user for a 60-minute time slot, and save it as <code>timeslot</code>. </li>
<li>Create an email to <a href="mailto:update@usada.org">update@usada.org</a> with the <code>location</code> and <code>timeslot</code> pre-populated in the body. </li>
<li>Send the email.</li>
</ol>

<h2>How to use it.</h2>

<p>With one tap from my iPhone or iPad, I can now instantly update USADA with my current whereabouts and a new 60-minute time slot, all without writing an email or opening Maps. I tap on the icon, add my 60 minute window from the picker, and the rest happens automatically. If I need to add additional details to the email, I can adjust the workflow to show the &lsquo;Compose Sheet&rsquo;, but I normally just let Workflow send the email instantly.</p>

<p>Updating is even easier on the Apple Watch. I open Workflow, press the &lsquo;Update USADA&rsquo; button, and I&rsquo;m done. </p>

<p>My biggest criticism of the app is that it was clearly built with a cross-platform solution such as <a href="http://xamarin.com">Xamarin</a> to make it available for Android and iOS. The proposed benefit is a single codebase that works on both platforms, but the result is often a mess that isn&rsquo;t optimized for either. The resulting crashes and conflicts with the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a> demonstrate the latter.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p>
