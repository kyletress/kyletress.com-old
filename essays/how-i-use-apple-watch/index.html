    <h1 class="page-header">How I use Apple Watch</h1>
    <p>I bought an Apple Watch on launch day, and since then I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot of questions about it. Besides the battery life (which is way better than expected), the most common question is &ldquo;what does it do?&rdquo;. People want to know how the Apple Watch would fit into their lives. Inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/@dmitribilgere/things-i-have-done-with-my-apple-watch-d7d31b289972">this post by Dmitir Bilgier</a>, I wanted to write about the main ways I&rsquo;ve used my Apple Watch so far. </p>

<p><strong>Mobile boarding pass</strong> &ndash; On a recent trip to Colorado, I used it to go through security and to check-in at the gate. Only once did I have problems scanning the QR code. It wouldn&rsquo;t scan at the gate in Chicago and I had to dig for my phone, holding up the line. Sorry folks. That aside, it made the airport experience more pleasant. </p>

<p><strong>Timing flights</strong> &ndash; 
The crew says the flight is going to be 2 hours and 30 minutes. Sounds great. What time did we leave again? How much longer do we have? What time zone am I going to? I timed all my flights takeoff to touchdown so I knew exactly how much flight time was remaining.</p>

<p><strong>Hey, Siri</strong> &ndash; I was a pretty regular Siri user before the Watch.  Now I can&rsquo;t imagine living without it. I&rsquo;m constantly asking Siri for directions, phone numbers, upcoming appointments, and reminders. Simply raising your wrist and saying &ldquo;Hey Siri&rdquo; activates it, which is great if you&rsquo;re driving and need directions. I&rsquo;ve also noticed a new feature: The &ldquo;new&rdquo; Siri is kind of a smart ass. </p>

<p><strong>Apple Pay</strong> &ndash; Using Apple Pay on the iPhone is fun. Using it on the watch is extraordinary. I still get excited to pay with Apple Watch, if only to see the cashier&rsquo;s reaction. I&rsquo;ve had several tell me I&rsquo;m the first to do so at their store. It feels like living in the future.  </p>

<p><strong>Daily reminder alarms</strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;m a notoriously bad eater. I have no problem eating once per day, performance effects be damned. Paired with medication that further reduces my appetite, I have to be diligent about my eating habits. I set seven daily alarms on repeat Monday - Friday to remind me to eat. Overkill? Yeah probably, but it works.  </p>

<p><strong>Updating USADA</strong> &ndash; I wrote about my need to <a href="/essays/usada-workflow">update USADA</a> on a regular basis. I automated the process with Workflow. No need to get my location or write an email. One tap and I&rsquo;m done, right from the watch.  </p>

<p><strong>Notify me to film my 1SE</strong> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve been filming one second every day since 2013. Some days I forget. I allow 1SE to notify me once per day, and I immediately shoot whatever is happening at that moment. </p>

<p><strong>Control my Apple TV</strong> &ndash; Using the watch as a remote is actually  easier than using the <em>real</em> Apple TV remote. I hate that thing. </p>

<p><strong>Weather station</strong> &ndash; Dark Sky notifies me up to an hour before light or heavy rain. I often ride my bike to training, so this is really helpful. </p>

<p><strong>Music</strong> &ndash; The watch has a few gigs set aside for music storage. Since the release of Apple Music, I&rsquo;ve started to take advantage of this by syncing playlists directly to it and pairing it with my Beats headphones. It&rsquo;s nice to warmup and workout without risking my iPhone hitting the ground.  </p>

<p><strong>Track and time my workout</strong> &ndash; One of the main reasons I bought the watch was to time my workouts (rest between sets, tempo runs, etc). Any watch could fill this role, but I like having a dedicated heart rate monitor, step counter, calorie counter, etc. The watch will almost certainly gain additional sensors over time, making it more useful in this capacity. One nitpick &ndash; there is no option for setting seconds in the timer. To get a 30-second timer, you have to ask Siri.</p>

<p><strong>Quickly respond to messages</strong> &ndash; It&rsquo;s amazing how often I can respond to a message right from the watch. It&rsquo;s smart, and will vary the suggested responses based on the message received. And if that doesn&rsquo;t work there&rsquo;s always dictation or an emoji :) .</p>

<p><strong>Silent notifications</strong> &ndash; Probably my favorite, and the most unsung, feature of the Apple Watch is a return to blissful silence. No more chimes, beeps, or ringtones. I feel a gentle tap on my wrist when a notification arrives, and I carefully control which get through. Before the watch I&rsquo;d hear three notifications for the same incoming message: one from my iPhone, one from my iPad, and another from my Mac. That drove me crazy, especially when silencing them wasn&rsquo;t an option. Now everything is on silent all the time, and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about missing truly important notifications. </p>

<p>Granted, my iPhone could do nearly everything above, but the benefit of the Apple Watch is <em>how</em> it accomplishes these tasks. I couldn&rsquo;t cover everything for the sake of brevity. Suffice it to say I&rsquo;m finding new uses every day. It&rsquo;s made a positive impact on my life, and I&rsquo;m excited to see what developers do with native apps and watchOS 2. Wearables are here, and Apple is leading the way. </p>
